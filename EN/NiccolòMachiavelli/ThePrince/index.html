<span>Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From 1494 to 1512</span><br/>
<span>held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic missions to</span><br/>
<span>various European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later exiled and</span><br/>
<span>returned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd June 1527.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>INTRODUCTION</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the</span><br/>
<span>second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,</span><br/>
<span>and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members</span><br/>
<span>of the old Florentine nobility.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly</span><br/>
<span>enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of</span><br/>
<span>Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an</span><br/>
<span>Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico.</span><br/>
<span>The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career</span><br/>
<span>Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted</span><br/>
<span>until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his</span><br/>
<span>office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they</span><br/>
<span>were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli's literary</span><br/>
<span>activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of</span><br/>
<span>the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth</span><br/>
<span>year, without having regained office.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>YOUTH -- Aet. 1-25--1469-94</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the</span><br/>
<span>Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of</span><br/>
<span>this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been</span><br/>
<span>described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by</span><br/>
<span>the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving</span><br/>
<span>Lorenzo. Savonarola's influence upon the young Machiavelli must have</span><br/>
<span>been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the</span><br/>
<span>fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of</span><br/>
<span>a gibe in "The Prince," where he is cited as an example of an unarmed</span><br/>
<span>prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean</span><br/>
<span>rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli</span><br/>
<span>strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to</span><br/>
<span>Lorenzo's grandson that he dedicates "The Prince."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli, in his "History of Florence," gives us a picture of the</span><br/>
<span>young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: "They were freer</span><br/>
<span>than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other</span><br/>
<span>kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,</span><br/>
<span>and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with</span><br/>
<span>wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly</span><br/>
<span>was thought the wisest." In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows</span><br/>
<span>why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads</span><br/>
<span>us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: "I</span><br/>
<span>have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,</span><br/>
<span>especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than</span><br/>
<span>which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and</span><br/>
<span>to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your</span><br/>
<span>share." Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: "This will turn</span><br/>
<span>out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you</span><br/>
<span>have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and</span><br/>
<span>music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I</span><br/>
<span>have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success</span><br/>
<span>and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you</span><br/>
<span>if you help yourself."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>OFFICE -- Aet. 25-43--1494-1512</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The second period of Machiavelli's life was spent in the service of the</span><br/>
<span>free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from</span><br/>
<span>the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After</span><br/>
<span>serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed</span><br/>
<span>Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty</span><br/>
<span>and Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli's life, for during this time he took a leading part in</span><br/>
<span>the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records,</span><br/>
<span>and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere</span><br/>
<span>recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and</span><br/>
<span>soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and</span><br/>
<span>supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters</span><br/>
<span>which illustrate "The Prince."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, "my lady of Forli" of</span><br/>
<span>"The Prince," from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it</span><br/>
<span>is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on</span><br/>
<span>fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is</span><br/>
<span>urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for</span><br/>
<span>continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct</span><br/>
<span>of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft</span><br/>
<span>summarized in "The Prince," and was consequently driven out. He, also,</span><br/>
<span>it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support</span><br/>
<span>to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge</span><br/>
<span>that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the</span><br/>
<span>faith of princes.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli's public life was largely occupied with events arising out</span><br/>
<span>of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the</span><br/>
<span>Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of "The Prince."</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the</span><br/>
<span>benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he</span><br/>
<span>can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare</span><br/>
<span>Borgia's conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as</span><br/>
<span>the "hero" of "The Prince." Yet in "The Prince" the duke is in point of</span><br/>
<span>fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and</span><br/>
<span>falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a</span><br/>
<span>prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all</span><br/>
<span>eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities</span><br/>
<span>fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an</span><br/>
<span>extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch</span><br/>
<span>the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated</span><br/>
<span>into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere</span><br/>
<span><i>(Julius II)</i>, who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear</span><br/>
<span>the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that</span><br/>
<span>he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old</span><br/>
<span>injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined</span><br/>
<span>Cesare.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff</span><br/>
<span>was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a</span><br/>
<span>successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly</span><br/>
<span>to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and</span><br/>
<span>concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win</span><br/>
<span>and hold them both.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian</span><br/>
<span>states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,</span><br/>
<span>with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those</span><br/>
<span>events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they</span><br/>
<span>impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with</span><br/>
<span>Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch's character has</span><br/>
<span>already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as</span><br/>
<span>the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but</span><br/>
<span>who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,</span><br/>
<span>had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been</span><br/>
<span>ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men</span><br/>
<span>of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret</span><br/>
<span>of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without</span><br/>
<span>force of character--ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry</span><br/>
<span>his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his</span><br/>
<span>wishes.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The remaining years of Machiavelli's official career were filled with</span><br/>
<span>events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the</span><br/>
<span>three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the</span><br/>
<span>object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in</span><br/>
<span>the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in</span><br/>
<span>eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these</span><br/>
<span>events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between</span><br/>
<span>the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the</span><br/>
<span>entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed</span><br/>
<span>the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss</span><br/>
<span>drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope,</span><br/>
<span>and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should</span><br/>
<span>be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September</span><br/>
<span>1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the</span><br/>
<span>dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his</span><br/>
<span>public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>LITERATURE AND DEATH -- Aet. 43-58--1512-27</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had</span><br/>
<span>vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was</span><br/>
<span>dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was</span><br/>
<span>accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,</span><br/>
<span>imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,</span><br/>
<span>Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San</span><br/>
<span>Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a</span><br/>
<span>letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left</span><br/>
<span>a very interesting description of his life at this period, which</span><br/>
<span>elucidates his methods and his motives in writing "The Prince." After</span><br/>
<span>describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he</span><br/>
<span>writes: "The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at</span><br/>
<span>the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,</span><br/>
<span>and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I</span><br/>
<span>pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly</span><br/>
<span>received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I</span><br/>
<span>do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their</span><br/>
<span>actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I</span><br/>
<span>feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,</span><br/>
<span>death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.</span><br/>
<span>And because Dante says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,</span><br/>
<span>Unfruitful else,</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have</span><br/>
<span>composed a small work on 'Principalities,' where I pour myself out</span><br/>
<span>as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a</span><br/>
<span>principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how</span><br/>
<span>they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever</span><br/>
<span>pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,</span><br/>
<span>especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it</span><br/>
<span>to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will</span><br/>
<span>be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with</span><br/>
<span>him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The "little book" suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form</span><br/>
<span>in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work</span><br/>
<span>during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some</span><br/>
<span>unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici. Although</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or</span><br/>
<span>presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo</span><br/>
<span>ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any</span><br/>
<span>employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli's lifetime,</span><br/>
<span>"The Prince" was never published by him, and its text is still</span><br/>
<span>disputable.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: "And as to this little</span><br/>
<span>thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the</span><br/>
<span>fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither</span><br/>
<span>slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who</span><br/>
<span>has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my loyalty none</span><br/>
<span>could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how</span><br/>
<span>to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot</span><br/>
<span>change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Before Machiavelli had got "The Prince" off his hands he commenced his</span><br/>
<span>"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius," which should be read</span><br/>
<span>concurrently with "The Prince." These and several minor works occupied</span><br/>
<span>him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look</span><br/>
<span>after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the</span><br/>
<span>Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to</span><br/>
<span>her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new</span><br/>
<span>constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on</span><br/>
<span>one pretext or another it was not promulgated.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli</span><br/>
<span>to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly</span><br/>
<span>remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he</span><br/>
<span>was much sought after, and also for the production of his "Art of War."</span><br/>
<span>It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance</span><br/>
<span>of Cardinal de' Medici to write the "History of Florence," a task</span><br/>
<span>which occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have</span><br/>
<span>determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer</span><br/>
<span>observes that "an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will</span><br/>
<span>endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play</span><br/>
<span>with."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When the "History of Florence" was finished, Machiavelli took it to</span><br/>
<span>Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de' Medici, who had in</span><br/>
<span>the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is somewhat</span><br/>
<span>remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written "The Prince" for</span><br/>
<span>the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in</span><br/>
<span>Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the "History of Florence" to the</span><br/>
<span>head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year the</span><br/>
<span>battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I</span><br/>
<span>a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This was followed</span><br/>
<span>by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at</span><br/>
<span>Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his</span><br/>
<span>return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the "Ten of</span><br/>
<span>Liberty and Peace." Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached</span><br/>
<span>Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE MAN AND HIS WORKS</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence</span><br/>
<span>has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her</span><br/>
<span>most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have</span><br/>
<span>found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the</span><br/>
<span>germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle</span><br/>
<span>to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,</span><br/>
<span>it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which</span><br/>
<span>this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that</span><br/>
<span>the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more</span><br/>
<span>reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an "unholy</span><br/>
<span>necromancer," which so long haunted men's vision, has begun to fade.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and</span><br/>
<span>industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and</span><br/>
<span>with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced</span><br/>
<span>retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he</span><br/>
<span>depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination,</span><br/>
<span>the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been</span><br/>
<span>only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political</span><br/>
<span>employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,</span><br/>
<span>overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of</span><br/>
<span>results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that</span><br/>
<span>he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct of his</span><br/>
<span>own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the</span><br/>
<span>side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising</span><br/>
<span>himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and</span><br/>
<span>Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to</span><br/>
<span>write the "History of Florence," rather than employ him in the state.</span><br/>
<span>And it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that</span><br/>
<span>we find no weakness and no failure.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on "The</span><br/>
<span>Prince," its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they</span><br/>
<span>are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as</span><br/>
<span>they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli's contemporaries; yet they</span><br/>
<span>cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe</span><br/>
<span>rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical incidents</span><br/>
<span>and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and</span><br/>
<span>conduct.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish</span><br/>
<span>some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, "The</span><br/>
<span>Prince" is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men</span><br/>
<span>are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the</span><br/>
<span>days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices</span><br/>
<span>which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.</span><br/>
<span>Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them</span><br/>
<span>to be--and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;</span><br/>
<span>prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then--to pass to</span><br/>
<span>a higher plane--Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win</span><br/>
<span>an empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and</span><br/>
<span>the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to</span><br/>
<span>fight.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli's that government</span><br/>
<span>should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the</span><br/>
<span>people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society;</span><br/>
<span>to this "high argument" "The Prince" contributes but little. Machiavelli</span><br/>
<span>always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than</span><br/>
<span>as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his</span><br/>
<span>work is of abiding value. But what invests "The Prince" with more than</span><br/>
<span>a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth</span><br/>
<span>that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and</span><br/>
<span>rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In translating "The Prince" my aim has been to achieve at all costs an</span><br/>
<span>exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase</span><br/>
<span>adapted to the modern notions of style and expression. Machiavelli was</span><br/>
<span>no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him</span><br/>
<span>to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his</span><br/>
<span>manner nobly plain and serious. "Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis</span><br/>
<span>rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?" In "The Prince," it may</span><br/>
<span>be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but</span><br/>
<span>for the position of every word. To an Englishman of Shakespeare's time</span><br/>
<span>the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy</span><br/>
<span>task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled</span><br/>
<span>that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so</span><br/>
<span>simple. To take a single example: the word "intrattenere," employed by</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards</span><br/>
<span>the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly</span><br/>
<span>rendered "entertain," and every contemporary reader would understand</span><br/>
<span>what was meant by saying that "Rome entertained the Aetolians and the</span><br/>
<span>Achaeans without augmenting their power." But to-day such a phrase would</span><br/>
<span>seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say</span><br/>
<span>that "Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians," etc.,</span><br/>
<span>using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the</span><br/>
<span>pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute</span><br/>
<span>fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can</span><br/>
<span>only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author's</span><br/>
<span>meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>DEDICATION</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De' Medici:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are</span><br/>
<span>accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most</span><br/>
<span>precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one</span><br/>
<span>often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and</span><br/>
<span>similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with</span><br/>
<span>some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among</span><br/>
<span>my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so</span><br/>
<span>much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by</span><br/>
<span>long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of</span><br/>
<span>antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and</span><br/>
<span>prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to</span><br/>
<span>your Magnificence.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And although I may consider this work unworthy of your</span><br/>
<span>countenance, nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it</span><br/>
<span>may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a</span><br/>
<span>better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in</span><br/>
<span>the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and</span><br/>
<span>with so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not</span><br/>
<span>embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with</span><br/>
<span>rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments</span><br/>
<span>whatever, with which so many are accustomed to embellish their</span><br/>
<span>works; for I have wished either that no honour should be given it,</span><br/>
<span>or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the</span><br/>
<span>theme shall make it acceptable.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man</span><br/>
<span>of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the</span><br/>
<span>concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes</span><br/>
<span>place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of</span><br/>
<span>the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the</span><br/>
<span>plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand</span><br/>
<span>the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to</span><br/>
<span>understand that of princes it needs to be of the people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Take then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in</span><br/>
<span>which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered</span><br/>
<span>by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain</span><br/>
<span>that greatness which fortune and your other attributes promise.</span><br/>
<span>And if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will</span><br/>
<span>sometimes turn your eyes to these lower regions, you will see how</span><br/>
<span>unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>

<span>THE PRINCE</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER I -- HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT</span><br/>
<span>MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been</span><br/>
<span>and are either republics or principalities.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long</span><br/>
<span>established; or they are new.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or</span><br/>
<span>they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the</span><br/>
<span>prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of</span><br/>
<span>the King of Spain.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a</span><br/>
<span>prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of</span><br/>
<span>the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER II -- CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another</span><br/>
<span>place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to</span><br/>
<span>principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,</span><br/>
<span>and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states,</span><br/>
<span>and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new</span><br/>
<span>ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his</span><br/>
<span>ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a</span><br/>
<span>prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he</span><br/>
<span>be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he</span><br/>
<span>should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the</span><br/>
<span>usurper, he will regain it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have</span><br/>
<span>withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius</span><br/>
<span>in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the</span><br/>
<span>hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it</span><br/>
<span>happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause</span><br/>
<span>him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be</span><br/>
<span>naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration</span><br/>
<span>of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for</span><br/>
<span>one change always leaves the toothing for another.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER III -- CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be</span><br/>
<span>not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken</span><br/>
<span>collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from</span><br/>
<span>an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for</span><br/>
<span>men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this</span><br/>
<span>hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they</span><br/>
<span>are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have</span><br/>
<span>gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common</span><br/>
<span>necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have</span><br/>
<span>submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships</span><br/>
<span>which he must put upon his new acquisition.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in</span><br/>
<span>seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends</span><br/>
<span>who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the</span><br/>
<span>way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,</span><br/>
<span>feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed</span><br/>
<span>forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill</span><br/>
<span>of the natives.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied</span><br/>
<span>Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it</span><br/>
<span>only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the</span><br/>
<span>gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future</span><br/>
<span>benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is</span><br/>
<span>very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,</span><br/>
<span>they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with</span><br/>
<span>little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the</span><br/>
<span>delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the</span><br/>
<span>weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was</span><br/>
<span>enough for the Duke Lodovico<i>(*)</i> to raise insurrections on the borders;</span><br/>
<span>but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring</span><br/>
<span>the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and</span><br/>
<span>driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco</span><br/>
<span>Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan</span><br/>
<span>from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second</span><br/>
<span>time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains</span><br/>
<span>to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what</span><br/>
<span>any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more</span><br/>
<span>securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an</span><br/>
<span>ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country</span><br/>
<span>and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,</span><br/>
<span>especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and</span><br/>
<span>to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the</span><br/>
<span>prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other</span><br/>
<span>things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live</span><br/>
<span>quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and</span><br/>
<span>Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,</span><br/>
<span>although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the</span><br/>
<span>customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst</span><br/>
<span>themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only</span><br/>
<span>to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their</span><br/>
<span>former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor</span><br/>
<span>their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become</span><br/>
<span>entirely one body with the old principality.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,</span><br/>
<span>customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great</span><br/>
<span>energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real</span><br/>
<span>helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.</span><br/>
<span>This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made</span><br/>
<span>that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures</span><br/>
<span>taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would</span><br/>
<span>not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders</span><br/>
<span>are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one</span><br/>
<span>is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one</span><br/>
<span>can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged</span><br/>
<span>by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the</span><br/>
<span>prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and</span><br/>
<span>wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state</span><br/>
<span>from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince</span><br/>
<span>resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest</span><br/>
<span>difficulty.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,</span><br/>
<span>which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do</span><br/>
<span>this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A</span><br/>
<span>prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he</span><br/>
<span>can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of</span><br/>
<span>the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new</span><br/>
<span>inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,</span><br/>
<span>are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily</span><br/>
<span>kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it</span><br/>
<span>should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In</span><br/>
<span>conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more</span><br/>
<span>faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being</span><br/>
<span>poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men</span><br/>
<span>ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge</span><br/>
<span>themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;</span><br/>
<span>therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a</span><br/>
<span>kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much</span><br/>
<span>more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the</span><br/>
<span>state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are</span><br/>
<span>exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting</span><br/>
<span>of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and</span><br/>
<span>all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their</span><br/>
<span>own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such</span><br/>
<span>guards are as useless as a colony is useful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects</span><br/>
<span>ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful</span><br/>
<span>neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care</span><br/>
<span>that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get</span><br/>
<span>a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be</span><br/>
<span>introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of</span><br/>
<span>ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were</span><br/>
<span>brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where</span><br/>
<span>they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the</span><br/>
<span>usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters</span><br/>
<span>a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred</span><br/>
<span>which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those</span><br/>
<span>subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to</span><br/>
<span>himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has</span><br/>
<span>acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of</span><br/>
<span>too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and</span><br/>
<span>with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,</span><br/>
<span>so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not</span><br/>
<span>properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and</span><br/>
<span>whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these</span><br/>
<span>measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with<i>(*)</i></span><br/>
<span>the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the</span><br/>
<span>greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.</span><br/>
<span>Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and</span><br/>
<span>Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was</span><br/>
<span>humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and</span><br/>
<span>Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor</span><br/>
<span>did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends</span><br/>
<span>without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them</span><br/>
<span>agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the</span><br/>
<span>Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,</span><br/>
<span>who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for</span><br/>
<span>which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is</span><br/>
<span>easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine</span><br/>
<span>is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it</span><br/>
<span>happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,</span><br/>
<span>that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to</span><br/>
<span>detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or</span><br/>
<span>treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to</span><br/>
<span>cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise</span><br/>
<span>have been foreseen <i>(which it is only given to a wise man to see)</i>, they</span><br/>
<span>can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,</span><br/>
<span>they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,</span><br/>
<span>there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,</span><br/>
<span>dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them</span><br/>
<span>come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only</span><br/>
<span>to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight</span><br/>
<span>with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;</span><br/>
<span>they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that</span><br/>
<span>ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our</span><br/>
<span>time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of</span><br/>
<span>their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and</span><br/>
<span>is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> See remark in the introduction on the word</span><br/>
<span>"intrattenere."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the</span><br/>
<span>things mentioned. I will speak of Louis<i>(*)</i> <i>(and not of Charles)</i><i>(+)</i> as</span><br/>
<span>the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held</span><br/>
<span>possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he</span><br/>
<span>has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a</span><br/>
<span>state composed of divers elements.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Louis XII, King of France, "The Father of the People,"</span><br/>
<span>born 1462, died 1515.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(+)</i> Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who</span><br/>
<span>desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I</span><br/>
<span>will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a</span><br/>
<span>foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every</span><br/>
<span>door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to</span><br/>
<span>accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded</span><br/>
<span>very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some</span><br/>
<span>mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once</span><br/>
<span>the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines</span><br/>
<span>became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the</span><br/>
<span>Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of</span><br/>
<span>Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the</span><br/>
<span>Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could</span><br/>
<span>the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which,</span><br/>
<span>in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king</span><br/>
<span>master of two-thirds of Italy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have</span><br/>
<span>maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid</span><br/>
<span>down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they</span><br/>
<span>were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church,</span><br/>
<span>some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to</span><br/>
<span>stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself</span><br/>
<span>secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in</span><br/>
<span>Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the</span><br/>
<span>Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening</span><br/>
<span>himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown</span><br/>
<span>themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much</span><br/>
<span>temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And</span><br/>
<span>having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so</span><br/>
<span>much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent</span><br/>
<span>his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into</span><br/>
<span>Italy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and</span><br/>
<span>deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,</span><br/>
<span>divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in</span><br/>
<span>Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and</span><br/>
<span>the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas</span><br/>
<span>he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove</span><br/>
<span>him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always</span><br/>
<span>do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but</span><br/>
<span>when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is</span><br/>
<span>folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with</span><br/>
<span>her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she</span><br/>
<span>ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with</span><br/>
<span>the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got</span><br/>
<span>a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not</span><br/>
<span>the excuse of that necessity.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,</span><br/>
<span>he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he</span><br/>
<span>brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not</span><br/>
<span>send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure</span><br/>
<span>him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the</span><br/>
<span>Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain</span><br/>
<span>into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble</span><br/>
<span>them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have</span><br/>
<span>consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have</span><br/>
<span>kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would</span><br/>
<span>never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also</span><br/>
<span>because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order</span><br/>
<span>to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not</span><br/>
<span>have had the courage.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if any one should say: "King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander</span><br/>
<span>and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war," I answer for the reasons given</span><br/>
<span>above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because</span><br/>
<span>it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And</span><br/>
<span>if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the</span><br/>
<span>Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the</span><br/>
<span>dissolution of his marriage<i>(*)</i> and for the cap to Rouen,<i>(+)</i> to that I</span><br/>
<span>reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and</span><br/>
<span>how it ought to be kept.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis</span><br/>
<span>XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles</span><br/>
<span>VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the</span><br/>
<span>crown.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(+)</i> The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d'Amboise,</span><br/>
<span>created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the</span><br/>
<span>conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and</span><br/>
<span>wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that</span><br/>
<span>is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes</span><br/>
<span>with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander,</span><br/>
<span>was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen</span><br/>
<span>observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied</span><br/>
<span>to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that</span><br/>
<span>otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such</span><br/>
<span>greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church</span><br/>
<span>and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be</span><br/>
<span>attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or</span><br/>
<span>rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful</span><br/>
<span>is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by</span><br/>
<span>astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been</span><br/>
<span>raised to power.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER IV -- WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT</span><br/>
<span>REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly</span><br/>
<span>acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the</span><br/>
<span>Great became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it</span><br/>
<span>was scarcely settled <i>(whence it might appear reasonable that the whole</span><br/>
<span>empire would have rebelled)</i>, nevertheless his successors maintained</span><br/>
<span>themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose</span><br/>
<span>among themselves from their own ambitions.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to</span><br/>
<span>be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body</span><br/>
<span>of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his</span><br/>
<span>favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity</span><br/>
<span>by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons</span><br/>
<span>have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold</span><br/>
<span>them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince</span><br/>
<span>and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all</span><br/>
<span>the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and</span><br/>
<span>if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and</span><br/>
<span>official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the</span><br/>
<span>King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord,</span><br/>
<span>the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he</span><br/>
<span>sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as</span><br/>
<span>he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient</span><br/>
<span>body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them;</span><br/>
<span>they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away</span><br/>
<span>except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states</span><br/>
<span>will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk,</span><br/>
<span>but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the</span><br/>
<span>difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper</span><br/>
<span>cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be</span><br/>
<span>assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around</span><br/>
<span>him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being</span><br/>
<span>all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and</span><br/>
<span>one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted,</span><br/>
<span>as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.</span><br/>
<span>Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him</span><br/>
<span>united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the</span><br/>
<span>revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed</span><br/>
<span>in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there</span><br/>
<span>is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being</span><br/>
<span>exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit</span><br/>
<span>with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his</span><br/>
<span>victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because</span><br/>
<span>one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,</span><br/>
<span>for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,</span><br/>
<span>for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the</span><br/>
<span>victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with</span><br/>
<span>infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from</span><br/>
<span>those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated</span><br/>
<span>the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves</span><br/>
<span>the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either</span><br/>
<span>to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings</span><br/>
<span>the opportunity.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of</span><br/>
<span>Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and</span><br/>
<span>therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in</span><br/>
<span>the field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory,</span><br/>
<span>Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the</span><br/>
<span>above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have</span><br/>
<span>enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised</span><br/>
<span>in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted</span><br/>
<span>like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the</span><br/>
<span>Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities</span><br/>
<span>there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them</span><br/>
<span>endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the</span><br/>
<span>power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed</span><br/>
<span>away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting</span><br/>
<span>afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself</span><br/>
<span>his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed</span><br/>
<span>there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other</span><br/>
<span>than the Romans were acknowledged.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with</span><br/>
<span>which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which</span><br/>
<span>others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;</span><br/>
<span>this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the</span><br/>
<span>conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER V -- CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH</span><br/>
<span>LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been</span><br/>
<span>accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three</span><br/>
<span>courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the</span><br/>
<span>next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live</span><br/>
<span>under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an</span><br/>
<span>oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a government,</span><br/>
<span>being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without</span><br/>
<span>his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and</span><br/>
<span>therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it</span><br/>
<span>more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held</span><br/>
<span>Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they</span><br/>
<span>lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,</span><br/>
<span>dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as</span><br/>
<span>the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did</span><br/>
<span>not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many</span><br/>
<span>cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them</span><br/>
<span>otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city</span><br/>
<span>accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be</span><br/>
<span>destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty</span><br/>
<span>and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time</span><br/>
<span>nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do or</span><br/>
<span>provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless</span><br/>
<span>they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately</span><br/>
<span>rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in</span><br/>
<span>bondage by the Florentines.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and</span><br/>
<span>his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to</span><br/>
<span>obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in</span><br/>
<span>making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern</span><br/>
<span>themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a</span><br/>
<span>prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But</span><br/>
<span>in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire</span><br/>
<span>for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their</span><br/>
<span>former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to</span><br/>
<span>reside there.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER VI -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE'S</span><br/>
<span>OWN ARMS AND ABILITY</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities</span><br/>
<span>as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of</span><br/>
<span>state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others, and</span><br/>
<span>following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely to</span><br/>
<span>the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A wise</span><br/>
<span>man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate</span><br/>
<span>those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal</span><br/>
<span>theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the clever</span><br/>
<span>archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far</span><br/>
<span>distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow</span><br/>
<span>attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their</span><br/>
<span>strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of</span><br/>
<span>so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is</span><br/>
<span>a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,</span><br/>
<span>accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired</span><br/>
<span>the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station</span><br/>
<span>presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other</span><br/>
<span>of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.</span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the</span><br/>
<span>strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no</span><br/>
<span>other state, is compelled to reside there in person.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,</span><br/>
<span>have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,</span><br/>
<span>and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not</span><br/>
<span>discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet</span><br/>
<span>he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to</span><br/>
<span>speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or</span><br/>
<span>founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular</span><br/>
<span>deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior</span><br/>
<span>to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor. And in</span><br/>
<span>examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything</span><br/>
<span>to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould</span><br/>
<span>into the form which seemed best to them. Without that opportunity their</span><br/>
<span>powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers</span><br/>
<span>the opportunity would have come in vain.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of</span><br/>
<span>Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that</span><br/>
<span>they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of</span><br/>
<span>bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and</span><br/>
<span>that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become</span><br/>
<span>King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary that Cyrus</span><br/>
<span>should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes,</span><br/>
<span>and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace. Theseus</span><br/>
<span>could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians</span><br/>
<span>dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,</span><br/>
<span>and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby</span><br/>
<span>their country was ennobled and made famous.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire</span><br/>
<span>a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The</span><br/>
<span>difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules</span><br/>
<span>and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their</span><br/>
<span>government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there</span><br/>
<span>is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or</span><br/>
<span>more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction</span><br/>
<span>of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies</span><br/>
<span>all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm</span><br/>
<span>defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises</span><br/>
<span>partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and</span><br/>
<span>partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new</span><br/>
<span>things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens</span><br/>
<span>that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they</span><br/>
<span>do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise</span><br/>
<span>that the prince is endangered along with them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter</span><br/>
<span>thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves</span><br/>
<span>or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate</span><br/>
<span>their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In the</span><br/>
<span>first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything;</span><br/>
<span>but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely</span><br/>
<span>endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the</span><br/>
<span>unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the reasons mentioned, the</span><br/>
<span>nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade</span><br/>
<span>them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion. And thus it is</span><br/>
<span>necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it</span><br/>
<span>may be possible to make them believe by force.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not</span><br/>
<span>have enforced their constitutions for long--as happened in our time to</span><br/>
<span>Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things</span><br/>
<span>immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means</span><br/>
<span>of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to</span><br/>
<span>believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating</span><br/>
<span>their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with</span><br/>
<span>ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those</span><br/>
<span>who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be</span><br/>
<span>respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured,</span><br/>
<span>and happy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some</span><br/>
<span>resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind:</span><br/>
<span>it is Hiero the Syracusan.<i>(*)</i> This man rose from a private station to</span><br/>
<span>be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but</span><br/>
<span>opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their</span><br/>
<span>captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince. He was</span><br/>
<span>of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes</span><br/>
<span>of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king. This man</span><br/>
<span>abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances,</span><br/>
<span>made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such</span><br/>
<span>foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had</span><br/>
<span>endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.</span><br/>

<span>CHAPTER VII -- CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER</span><br/>
<span>BY THE ARMS OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private</span><br/>
<span>citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they</span><br/>
<span>have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they have</span><br/>
<span>many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state</span><br/>
<span>is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it;</span><br/>
<span>as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the</span><br/>
<span>Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might</span><br/>
<span>hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those</span><br/>
<span>emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens</span><br/>
<span>came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the</span><br/>
<span>fortune of him who has elevated them--two most inconstant and unstable</span><br/>
<span>things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;</span><br/>
<span>because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not</span><br/>
<span>reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always</span><br/>
<span>lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they</span><br/>
<span>have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature</span><br/>
<span>which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and</span><br/>
<span>correspondencies<i>(*)</i> fixed in such a way that the first storm will</span><br/>
<span>not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become</span><br/>
<span>princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be</span><br/>
<span>prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,</span><br/>
<span>and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became</span><br/>
<span>princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Le radici e corrispondenze," their roots <i>(i.e.</span><br/>
<span>foundations)</i> and correspondencies or relations with other</span><br/>
<span>states--a common meaning of "correspondence" and</span><br/>
<span>"correspondency" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or</span><br/>
<span>fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and</span><br/>
<span>these are Francesco Sforza<i>(*)</i> and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper</span><br/>
<span>means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be</span><br/>
<span>Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties</span><br/>
<span>he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by</span><br/>
<span>the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of</span><br/>
<span>his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had</span><br/>
<span>taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and</span><br/>
<span>able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and</span><br/>
<span>fortunes of others had bestowed on him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married</span><br/>
<span>Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo</span><br/>
<span>Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his</span><br/>
<span>own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli was the accredited</span><br/>
<span>agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia <i>(1478-</span><br/>
<span>1507)</i> during the transactions which led up to the</span><br/>
<span>assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and</span><br/>
<span>along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left</span><br/>
<span>an account, written ten years before "The Prince," of the</span><br/>
<span>proceedings of the duke in his "Descritione del modo tenuto</span><br/>
<span>dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,"</span><br/>
<span>etc., a translation of which is appended to the present</span><br/>
<span>work.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations</span><br/>
<span>may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will</span><br/>
<span>be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,</span><br/>
<span>therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be</span><br/>
<span>seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not</span><br/>
<span>consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what</span><br/>
<span>better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;</span><br/>
<span>and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but</span><br/>
<span>the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had</span><br/>
<span>many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his</span><br/>
<span>way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church;</span><br/>
<span>and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan</span><br/>
<span>and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were</span><br/>
<span>already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the</span><br/>
<span>arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in</span><br/>
<span>hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini</span><br/>
<span>and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore,</span><br/>
<span>to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make</span><br/>
<span>himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him</span><br/>
<span>to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined</span><br/>
<span>to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this,</span><br/>
<span>but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of</span><br/>
<span>King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of</span><br/>
<span>the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan</span><br/>
<span>than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna,</span><br/>
<span>which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore,</span><br/>
<span>having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to</span><br/>
<span>hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one,</span><br/>
<span>his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of</span><br/>
<span>France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which</span><br/>
<span>he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder</span><br/>
<span>him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and</span><br/>
<span>that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning</span><br/>
<span>when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very</span><br/>
<span>unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when</span><br/>
<span>he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the</span><br/>
<span>king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to</span><br/>
<span>depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in</span><br/>
<span>Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span>making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their</span><br/>
<span>rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few</span><br/>
<span>months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely</span><br/>
<span>to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini,</span><br/>
<span>having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him</span><br/>
<span>soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the</span><br/>
<span>aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a</span><br/>
<span>meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at</span><br/>
<span>Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke,</span><br/>
<span>all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored</span><br/>
<span>his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French</span><br/>
<span>or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew</span><br/>
<span>so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor</span><br/>
<span>Pagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of</span><br/>
<span>attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini were</span><br/>
<span>reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power</span><br/>
<span>at Sinigalia.<i>(*)</i> Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their</span><br/>
<span>partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations</span><br/>
<span>to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the</span><br/>
<span>people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them</span><br/>
<span>all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice, and to be</span><br/>
<span>imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak</span><br/>
<span>masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave</span><br/>
<span>them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was</span><br/>
<span>full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing</span><br/>
<span>to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it</span><br/>
<span>necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer</span><br/>
<span>Ramiro d'Orco,<i>(*)</i> a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest</span><br/>
<span>power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the</span><br/>
<span>greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not</span><br/>
<span>advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but</span><br/>
<span>that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the</span><br/>
<span>country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their</span><br/>
<span>advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some</span><br/>
<span>hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people,</span><br/>
<span>and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any</span><br/>
<span>cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the</span><br/>
<span>natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro,</span><br/>
<span>and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at</span><br/>
<span>Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of</span><br/>
<span>this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Ramiro d'Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding</span><br/>
<span>himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate</span><br/>
<span>dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great</span><br/>
<span>measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he</span><br/>
<span>wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for</span><br/>
<span>he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not</span><br/>
<span>support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and to</span><br/>
<span>temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the</span><br/>
<span>kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta. It</span><br/>
<span>was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have</span><br/>
<span>quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future</span><br/>
<span>he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church</span><br/>
<span>might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which</span><br/>
<span>Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by</span><br/>
<span>exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as</span><br/>
<span>to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself</span><br/>
<span>all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their</span><br/>
<span>aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to</span><br/>
<span>himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die</span><br/>
<span>that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four</span><br/>
<span>things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had</span><br/>
<span>killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and</span><br/>
<span>few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the</span><br/>
<span>most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he</span><br/>
<span>intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia</span><br/>
<span>and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer</span><br/>
<span>to study France <i>(for the French were already driven out of the kingdom</span><br/>
<span>of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy</span><br/>
<span>his goodwill)</i>, he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena</span><br/>
<span>yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of</span><br/>
<span>the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he</span><br/>
<span>continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died,</span><br/>
<span>for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have</span><br/>
<span>stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces</span><br/>
<span>of others, but solely on his own power and ability.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He</span><br/>
<span>left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the</span><br/>
<span>rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto</span><br/>
<span>death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew</span><br/>
<span>so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations</span><br/>
<span>which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those</span><br/>
<span>armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have</span><br/>
<span>overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his foundations were</span><br/>
<span>good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month. In Rome,</span><br/>
<span>although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni,</span><br/>
<span>the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect</span><br/>
<span>anything against him. If he could not have made Pope him whom he wished,</span><br/>
<span>at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected. But</span><br/>
<span>if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,<i>(*)</i> everything</span><br/>
<span>would have been different to him. On the day that Julius the Second<i>(+)</i></span><br/>
<span>was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might</span><br/>
<span>occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all,</span><br/>
<span>except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he</span><br/>
<span>himself would be on the point to die.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(+)</i> Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San</span><br/>
<span>Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to</span><br/>
<span>blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to</span><br/>
<span>offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of</span><br/>
<span>others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and</span><br/>
<span>far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise,</span><br/>
<span>and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness</span><br/>
<span>frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to</span><br/>
<span>secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome</span><br/>
<span>either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the</span><br/>
<span>people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those</span><br/>
<span>who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things</span><br/>
<span>for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy</span><br/>
<span>a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings</span><br/>
<span>and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend</span><br/>
<span>with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this</span><br/>
<span>man.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he</span><br/>
<span>made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope</span><br/>
<span>to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected</span><br/>
<span>Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any</span><br/>
<span>cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became</span><br/>
<span>pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom he</span><br/>
<span>had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San</span><br/>
<span>Giorgio, and Ascanio.<i>(*)</i> The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him,</span><br/>
<span>Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and</span><br/>
<span>obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having</span><br/>
<span>relations with him. Therefore, above everything, the duke ought to have</span><br/>
<span>created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to</span><br/>
<span>Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula. He who believes that new benefits</span><br/>
<span>will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived.</span><br/>
<span>Therefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his</span><br/>
<span>ultimate ruin.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio</span><br/>
<span>Sforza.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER VIII -- CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY</span><br/>
<span>WICKEDNESS</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither</span><br/>
<span>of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is</span><br/>
<span>manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be</span><br/>
<span>more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are</span><br/>
<span>when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the</span><br/>
<span>principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private</span><br/>
<span>person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first</span><br/>
<span>method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other</span><br/>
<span>modern--and without entering further into the subject, I consider these</span><br/>
<span>two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Agathocles, the Sicilian,<i>(*)</i> became King of Syracuse not only from</span><br/>
<span>a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a</span><br/>
<span>potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous</span><br/>
<span>life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of</span><br/>
<span>mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,</span><br/>
<span>he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established</span><br/>
<span>in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself</span><br/>
<span>prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that</span><br/>
<span>which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding</span><br/>
<span>for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was</span><br/>
<span>fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate</span><br/>
<span>of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the</span><br/>
<span>Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and</span><br/>
<span>the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom</span><br/>
<span>of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice</span><br/>
<span>routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was</span><br/>
<span>he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence,</span><br/>
<span>with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the</span><br/>
<span>siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were</span><br/>
<span>compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him,</span><br/>
<span>had to be content with the possession of Africa.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will</span><br/>
<span>see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as</span><br/>
<span>he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any</span><br/>
<span>one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were</span><br/>
<span>gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly</span><br/>
<span>held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent</span><br/>
<span>to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,</span><br/>
<span>without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but</span><br/>
<span>not glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and</span><br/>
<span>extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his</span><br/>
<span>greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be</span><br/>
<span>seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.</span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite</span><br/>
<span>wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent</span><br/>
<span>men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da</span><br/>
<span>Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up</span><br/>
<span>by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his</span><br/>
<span>youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under</span><br/>
<span>his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military</span><br/>
<span>profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,</span><br/>
<span>and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body</span><br/>
<span>and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing</span><br/>
<span>a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some</span><br/>
<span>citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than</span><br/>
<span>its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So</span><br/>
<span>he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many</span><br/>
<span>years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look</span><br/>
<span>upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything</span><br/>
<span>except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not</span><br/>
<span>spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be</span><br/>
<span>accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he</span><br/>
<span>entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by</span><br/>
<span>the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to</span><br/>
<span>that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,</span><br/>
<span>and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he</span><br/>
<span>lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having</span><br/>
<span>arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a</span><br/>
<span>solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of</span><br/>
<span>Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual</span><br/>
<span>in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave</span><br/>
<span>discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son</span><br/>
<span>Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others</span><br/>
<span>answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be</span><br/>
<span>discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber,</span><br/>
<span>whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No</span><br/>
<span>sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and</span><br/>
<span>slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,</span><br/>
<span>mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief</span><br/>
<span>magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey</span><br/>
<span>him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He</span><br/>
<span>killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened</span><br/>
<span>himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in</span><br/>
<span>the year during which he held the principality, not only was he</span><br/>
<span>secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his</span><br/>
<span>neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that</span><br/>
<span>of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare</span><br/>
<span>Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was</span><br/>
<span>stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this parricide, he</span><br/>
<span>was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in</span><br/>
<span>valour and wickedness.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after</span><br/>
<span>infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in</span><br/>
<span>his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be</span><br/>
<span>conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means</span><br/>
<span>of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the</span><br/>
<span>state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this</span><br/>
<span>follows from severities<i>(*)</i> being badly or properly used. Those may be</span><br/>
<span>called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are</span><br/>
<span>applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are</span><br/>
<span>not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage</span><br/>
<span>of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding</span><br/>
<span>they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than</span><br/>
<span>decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God</span><br/>
<span>or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is</span><br/>
<span>impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the</span><br/>
<span>modern equivalent of Machiavelli's thought when he speaks of</span><br/>
<span>"crudelta" than the more obvious "cruelties."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought</span><br/>
<span>to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him</span><br/>
<span>to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat</span><br/>
<span>them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure</span><br/>
<span>them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either</span><br/>
<span>from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife</span><br/>
<span>in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach</span><br/>
<span>themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For</span><br/>
<span>injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less,</span><br/>
<span>they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that</span><br/>
<span>the flavour of them may last longer.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such</span><br/>
<span>a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall</span><br/>
<span>make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled</span><br/>
<span>times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help</span><br/>
<span>you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be</span><br/>
<span>under any obligation to you for them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER IX -- CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes the</span><br/>
<span>prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,</span><br/>
<span>but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civil</span><br/>
<span>principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain to</span><br/>
<span>it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a principality</span><br/>
<span>is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the</span><br/>
<span>nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties are found,</span><br/>
<span>and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor</span><br/>
<span>oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the</span><br/>
<span>people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one</span><br/>
<span>of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,</span><br/>
<span>accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles,</span><br/>
<span>seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation</span><br/>
<span>of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his</span><br/>
<span>shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, finding</span><br/>
<span>they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of</span><br/>
<span>themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.</span><br/>
<span>He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains</span><br/>
<span>himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of</span><br/>
<span>the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who</span><br/>
<span>consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule</span><br/>
<span>nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular</span><br/>
<span>favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not</span><br/>
<span>prepared to obey him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,</span><br/>
<span>satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is</span><br/>
<span>more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,</span><br/>
<span>while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added also</span><br/>
<span>that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because</span><br/>
<span>of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself,</span><br/>
<span>as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a</span><br/>
<span>hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he</span><br/>
<span>has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against</span><br/>
<span>him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always</span><br/>
<span>come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him</span><br/>
<span>whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is compelled to live</span><br/>
<span>always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles,</span><br/>
<span>being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away</span><br/>
<span>authority when it pleases him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to</span><br/>
<span>be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their</span><br/>
<span>course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do</span><br/>
<span>not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be</span><br/>
<span>honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt</span><br/>
<span>with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a</span><br/>
<span>natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,</span><br/>
<span>especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in</span><br/>
<span>prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.</span><br/>
<span>But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it</span><br/>
<span>is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,</span><br/>
<span>and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they</span><br/>
<span>were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people</span><br/>
<span>ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they</span><br/>
<span>only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to</span><br/>
<span>the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above</span><br/>
<span>everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may</span><br/>
<span>easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they</span><br/>
<span>receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more</span><br/>
<span>closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted</span><br/>
<span>to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours;</span><br/>
<span>and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary</span><br/>
<span>according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit</span><br/>
<span>them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people</span><br/>
<span>friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nabis,<i>(*)</i> Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,</span><br/>
<span>and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country</span><br/>
<span>and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only</span><br/>
<span>necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would</span><br/>
<span>not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not let any</span><br/>
<span>one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that "He who builds on</span><br/>
<span>the people, builds on the mud," for this is true when a private citizen</span><br/>
<span>makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will</span><br/>
<span>free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates;</span><br/>
<span>wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the</span><br/>
<span>Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali<i>(+)</i> in Florence. But granted</span><br/>
<span>a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is</span><br/>
<span>a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other</span><br/>
<span>qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole</span><br/>
<span>people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them,</span><br/>
<span>and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under</span><br/>
<span>Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(+)</i> Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in</span><br/>
<span>Machiavelli's "Florentine History," Book III.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the</span><br/>
<span>civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule</span><br/>
<span>personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their government</span><br/>
<span>is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill</span><br/>
<span>of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially</span><br/>
<span>in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either</span><br/>
<span>by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid</span><br/>
<span>tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and</span><br/>
<span>subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of</span><br/>
<span>a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in</span><br/>
<span>doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For such a prince</span><br/>
<span>cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have</span><br/>
<span>need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all</span><br/>
<span>promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him;</span><br/>
<span>but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then</span><br/>
<span>he finds but few. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous,</span><br/>
<span>inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore a wise prince ought to</span><br/>
<span>adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and</span><br/>
<span>kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will</span><br/>
<span>always find them faithful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER X -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL</span><br/>
<span>PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of</span><br/>
<span>these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in</span><br/>
<span>case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether</span><br/>
<span>he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite</span><br/>
<span>clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by</span><br/>
<span>their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise</span><br/>
<span>a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack</span><br/>
<span>them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot</span><br/>
<span>show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to</span><br/>
<span>defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been</span><br/>
<span>discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second</span><br/>
<span>case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision</span><br/>
<span>and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.</span><br/>
<span>And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the</span><br/>
<span>other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often</span><br/>
<span>repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are</span><br/>
<span>always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it</span><br/>
<span>will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well</span><br/>
<span>fortified, and is not hated by his people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country</span><br/>
<span>around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits</span><br/>
<span>them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,</span><br/>
<span>because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the</span><br/>
<span>taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they</span><br/>
<span>have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they</span><br/>
<span>always keep in public depots enough for one year's eating, drinking, and</span><br/>
<span>firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to</span><br/>
<span>the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community</span><br/>
<span>in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on</span><br/>
<span>the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military</span><br/>
<span>exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself</span><br/>
<span>odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only</span><br/>
<span>be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this</span><br/>
<span>world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole</span><br/>
<span>year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should</span><br/>
<span>reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt,</span><br/>
<span>they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will</span><br/>
<span>make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and</span><br/>
<span>courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one</span><br/>
<span>time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another</span><br/>
<span>time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly</span><br/>
<span>from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin</span><br/>
<span>the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and</span><br/>
<span>ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince</span><br/>
<span>to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage</span><br/>
<span>is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any</span><br/>
<span>remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with</span><br/>
<span>their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that</span><br/>
<span>their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his</span><br/>
<span>defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they</span><br/>
<span>confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is</span><br/>
<span>well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the</span><br/>
<span>minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not</span><br/>
<span>fail to support and defend them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XI -- CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching</span><br/>
<span>which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they</span><br/>
<span>are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held</span><br/>
<span>without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of</span><br/>
<span>religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the</span><br/>
<span>principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.</span><br/>
<span>These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have</span><br/>
<span>subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are</span><br/>
<span>not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,</span><br/>
<span>and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves.</span><br/>
<span>Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by</span><br/>
<span>powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of</span><br/>
<span>them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act</span><br/>
<span>of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the</span><br/>
<span>Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from</span><br/>
<span>Alexander backwards the Italian potentates <i>(not only those who have been</span><br/>
<span>called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)</i></span><br/>
<span>have valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France</span><br/>
<span>trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and</span><br/>
<span>to ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not</span><br/>
<span>appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Before Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,<i>(*)</i> this country was</span><br/>
<span>under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the</span><br/>
<span>Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal</span><br/>
<span>anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the</span><br/>
<span>other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about</span><br/>
<span>whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To</span><br/>
<span>restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it</span><br/>
<span>was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use</span><br/>
<span>of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and</span><br/>
<span>Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in</span><br/>
<span>their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and</span><br/>
<span>powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope,</span><br/>
<span>such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these</span><br/>
<span>annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness;</span><br/>
<span>for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with</span><br/>
<span>difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people</span><br/>
<span>should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the</span><br/>
<span>Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time</span><br/>
<span>to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the</span><br/>
<span>pope were little esteemed in Italy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that</span><br/>
<span>have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to</span><br/>
<span>prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by</span><br/>
<span>reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things</span><br/>
<span>which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although</span><br/>
<span>his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,</span><br/>
<span>nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,</span><br/>
<span>which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all</span><br/>
<span>his labours.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all</span><br/>
<span>the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the</span><br/>
<span>chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found</span><br/>
<span>the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been</span><br/>
<span>practised before Alexander's time. Such things Julius not only followed,</span><br/>
<span>but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the</span><br/>
<span>Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these</span><br/>
<span>enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,</span><br/>
<span>inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any</span><br/>
<span>private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within</span><br/>
<span>the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them</span><br/>
<span>some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the</span><br/>
<span>one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the</span><br/>
<span>other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the</span><br/>
<span>disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals</span><br/>
<span>they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions</span><br/>
<span>in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and</span><br/>
<span>thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among</span><br/>
<span>the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo<i>(*)</i> found the</span><br/>
<span>pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it</span><br/>
<span>great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his</span><br/>
<span>goodness and infinite other virtues.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de' Medici.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XII -- HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING</span><br/>
<span>MERCENARIES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such</span><br/>
<span>principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having</span><br/>
<span>considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and</span><br/>
<span>having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and</span><br/>
<span>to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of</span><br/>
<span>offence and defence which belong to each of them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his</span><br/>
<span>foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go</span><br/>
<span>to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or</span><br/>
<span>composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws</span><br/>
<span>where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well</span><br/>
<span>armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion</span><br/>
<span>and shall speak of the arms.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state</span><br/>
<span>are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.</span><br/>
<span>Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds</span><br/>
<span>his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe;</span><br/>
<span>for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,</span><br/>
<span>valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the</span><br/>
<span>fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so</span><br/>
<span>long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war</span><br/>
<span>by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for</span><br/>
<span>keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient</span><br/>
<span>to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be</span><br/>
<span>your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take</span><br/>
<span>themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble</span><br/>
<span>to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by</span><br/>
<span>resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they</span><br/>
<span>formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet</span><br/>
<span>when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that</span><br/>
<span>Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in</span><br/>
<span>hand;<i>(*)</i> and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the</span><br/>
<span>truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have</span><br/>
<span>related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who</span><br/>
<span>have also suffered the penalty.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "With chalk in hand," "col gesso." This is one of the</span><br/>
<span>_bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with</span><br/>
<span>which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only</span><br/>
<span>necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the</span><br/>
<span>billets for his soldiers to conquer the country. Cf. "The</span><br/>
<span>History of Henry VII," by Lord Bacon: "King Charles had</span><br/>
<span>conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind</span><br/>
<span>of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of</span><br/>
<span>Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope</span><br/>
<span>Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into</span><br/>
<span>Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,</span><br/>
<span>rather than with swords to fight."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The</span><br/>
<span>mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they</span><br/>
<span>are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own</span><br/>
<span>greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others</span><br/>
<span>contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are</span><br/>
<span>ruined in the usual way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,</span><br/>
<span>whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to,</span><br/>
<span>either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in</span><br/>
<span>person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its</span><br/>
<span>citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it</span><br/>
<span>ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so</span><br/>
<span>that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes and</span><br/>
<span>republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries</span><br/>
<span>doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a</span><br/>
<span>republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens</span><br/>
<span>than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood</span><br/>
<span>for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely armed and</span><br/>
<span>quite free.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who</span><br/>
<span>were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the</span><br/>
<span>Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.</span><br/>
<span>After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of</span><br/>
<span>their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their</span><br/>
<span>liberty.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against</span><br/>
<span>the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,<i>(*)</i></span><br/>
<span>allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father,</span><br/>
<span>Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna<i>(+)</i> of Naples, left her</span><br/>
<span>unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of</span><br/>
<span>the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the Venetians</span><br/>
<span>and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet</span><br/>
<span>their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them,</span><br/>
<span>I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance,</span><br/>
<span>for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some</span><br/>
<span>have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their</span><br/>
<span>ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,<i>(%)</i> and</span><br/>
<span>since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one</span><br/>
<span>will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have</span><br/>
<span>stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him,</span><br/>
<span>so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy;</span><br/>
<span>Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come</span><br/>
<span>to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as</span><br/>
<span>their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private</span><br/>
<span>position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa,</span><br/>
<span>nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to</span><br/>
<span>keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had</span><br/>
<span>no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The</span><br/>
<span>Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have</span><br/>
<span>acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men,</span><br/>
<span>when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was</span><br/>
<span>before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight</span><br/>
<span>on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And</span><br/>
<span>in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much</span><br/>
<span>territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much</span><br/>
<span>to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under</span><br/>
<span>Carmignuola,<i>(#)</i> they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him</span><br/>
<span>a most valiant man <i>(they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership)</i>,</span><br/>
<span>and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they</span><br/>
<span>feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they</span><br/>
<span>were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose</span><br/>
<span>again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to</span><br/>
<span>secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their</span><br/>
<span>captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of</span><br/>
<span>Pitigliano,<i>(&)</i> and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not</span><br/>
<span>gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,<i>($)</i> where in one battle they</span><br/>
<span>lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much</span><br/>
<span>trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed</span><br/>
<span>and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled</span><br/>
<span>for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,</span><br/>
<span>in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better</span><br/>
<span>prepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has</span><br/>
<span>recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more</span><br/>
<span>temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states,</span><br/>
<span>for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their</span><br/>
<span>nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them,</span><br/>
<span>whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal</span><br/>
<span>power: in many others their citizens became princes. From this it came</span><br/>
<span>to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of</span><br/>
<span>republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of</span><br/>
<span>citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,<i>(*)</i> the</span><br/>
<span>Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and</span><br/>
<span>Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came</span><br/>
<span>all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy;</span><br/>
<span>and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun</span><br/>
<span>by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the</span><br/>
<span>Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower</span><br/>
<span>the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did</span><br/>
<span>this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were</span><br/>
<span>unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them</span><br/>
<span>any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force</span><br/>
<span>of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to</span><br/>
<span>such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were</span><br/>
<span>not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used</span><br/>
<span>every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers,</span><br/>
<span>not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without</span><br/>
<span>ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the</span><br/>
<span>towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either</span><br/>
<span>with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these</span><br/>
<span>things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to</span><br/>
<span>avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought</span><br/>
<span>Italy to slavery and contempt.</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XIII -- CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE'S OWN</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince</span><br/>
<span>is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope</span><br/>
<span>Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise</span><br/>
<span>against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to</span><br/>
<span>auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,<i>(*)</i> for his</span><br/>
<span>assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good</span><br/>
<span>in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always</span><br/>
<span>disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their</span><br/>
<span>captive.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Ferdinand V <i>(F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of</span><br/>
<span>Naples)</i>, surnamed "The Catholic," born 1452, died 1516.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish</span><br/>
<span>to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which</span><br/>
<span>cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw</span><br/>
<span>himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune</span><br/>
<span>brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his</span><br/>
<span>rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and</span><br/>
<span>the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors <i>(against all</span><br/>
<span>expectation, both his and others)</i>, it so came to pass that he did</span><br/>
<span>not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his</span><br/>
<span>auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand</span><br/>
<span>Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other</span><br/>
<span>time of their troubles.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Emperor of Constantinople,<i>(*)</i> to oppose his neighbours, sent ten</span><br/>
<span>thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not</span><br/>
<span>willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to</span><br/>
<span>the infidels.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,</span><br/>
<span>for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the</span><br/>
<span>ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others;</span><br/>
<span>but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better</span><br/>
<span>opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one</span><br/>
<span>community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you</span><br/>
<span>have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority</span><br/>
<span>to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous;</span><br/>
<span>in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided</span><br/>
<span>these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose</span><br/>
<span>with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real</span><br/>
<span>victory which is gained with the arms of others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke</span><br/>
<span>entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers,</span><br/>
<span>and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces</span><br/>
<span>not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less</span><br/>
<span>danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently,</span><br/>
<span>on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he</span><br/>
<span>destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one</span><br/>
<span>and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers</span><br/>
<span>the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the</span><br/>
<span>French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his</span><br/>
<span>own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever</span><br/>
<span>increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw</span><br/>
<span>that he was complete master of his own forces.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am</span><br/>
<span>unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I</span><br/>
<span>have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the</span><br/>
<span>Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like</span><br/>
<span>our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he</span><br/>
<span>could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces,</span><br/>
<span>and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament</span><br/>
<span>applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with</span><br/>
<span>Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed</span><br/>
<span>him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them</span><br/>
<span>on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to</span><br/>
<span>meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of</span><br/>
<span>others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind</span><br/>
<span>you fast.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Charles the Seventh,<i>(*)</i> the father of King Louis the Eleventh,<i>(+)</i> having</span><br/>
<span>by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized</span><br/>
<span>the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established</span><br/>
<span>in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry.</span><br/>
<span>Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to</span><br/>
<span>enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now</span><br/>
<span>seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the</span><br/>
<span>reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of</span><br/>
<span>his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his</span><br/>
<span>men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so</span><br/>
<span>accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they</span><br/>
<span>can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot</span><br/>
<span>stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come</span><br/>
<span>off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become</span><br/>
<span>mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together</span><br/>
<span>are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much</span><br/>
<span>inferior to one's own forces. And this example proves it, for the</span><br/>
<span>kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had</span><br/>
<span>been enlarged or maintained.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Charles VII of France, surnamed "The Victorious," born</span><br/>
<span>1403, died 1461.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(+)</i> Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks</span><br/>
<span>well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have</span><br/>
<span>said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality</span><br/>
<span>cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise;</span><br/>
<span>and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster to the Roman</span><br/>
<span>Empire<i>(*)</i> should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only</span><br/>
<span>with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of</span><br/>
<span>the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised</span><br/>
<span>it passed away to others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Many speakers to the House the other night in the</span><br/>
<span>debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most</span><br/>
<span>lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the</span><br/>
<span>British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr Balfour</span><br/>
<span>replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under</span><br/>
<span>the weight of its military obligations, he said that this</span><br/>
<span>was 'wholly unhistorical.' He might well have added that the</span><br/>
<span>Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen</span><br/>
<span>acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that</span><br/>
<span>it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer</span><br/>
<span>recognized."--Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its</span><br/>
<span>own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune,</span><br/>
<span>not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has</span><br/>
<span>always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so</span><br/>
<span>uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.</span><br/>
<span>And one's own forces are those which are composed either of subjects,</span><br/>
<span>citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And</span><br/>
<span>the way to make ready one's own forces will be easily found if the rules</span><br/>
<span>suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider</span><br/>
<span>how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and</span><br/>
<span>princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely</span><br/>
<span>commit myself.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XIV -- THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF</span><br/>
<span>WAR</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else</span><br/>
<span>for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is the</span><br/>
<span>sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it</span><br/>
<span>not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men</span><br/>
<span>to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the contrary, it is</span><br/>
<span>seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have</span><br/>
<span>lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect</span><br/>
<span>this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of</span><br/>
<span>the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person</span><br/>
<span>became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and</span><br/>
<span>troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other</span><br/>
<span>evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and</span><br/>
<span>this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard</span><br/>
<span>himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate</span><br/>
<span>between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who</span><br/>
<span>is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that</span><br/>
<span>the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there</span><br/>
<span>being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible</span><br/>
<span>for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not</span><br/>
<span>understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already</span><br/>
<span>mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them.</span><br/>
<span>He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of</span><br/>
<span>war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in</span><br/>
<span>war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well</span><br/>
<span>organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he</span><br/>
<span>accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of</span><br/>
<span>localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys</span><br/>
<span>open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and</span><br/>
<span>marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge</span><br/>
<span>is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country, and</span><br/>
<span>is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the</span><br/>
<span>knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any</span><br/>
<span>other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because</span><br/>
<span>the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for</span><br/>
<span>instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other</span><br/>
<span>countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can</span><br/>
<span>easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this</span><br/>
<span>skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should</span><br/>
<span>possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters,</span><br/>
<span>to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Philopoemen,<i>(*)</i> Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which</span><br/>
<span>writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he</span><br/>
<span>never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in</span><br/>
<span>the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: "If</span><br/>
<span>the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here</span><br/>
<span>with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best</span><br/>
<span>advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,</span><br/>
<span>how ought we to pursue?" And he would set forth to them, as he went, all</span><br/>
<span>the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion</span><br/>
<span>and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual</span><br/>
<span>discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected</span><br/>
<span>circumstances that he could not deal with.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Philopoemen, "the last of the Greeks," born 252 B.C.,</span><br/>
<span>died 183 B.C.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and</span><br/>
<span>study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne</span><br/>
<span>themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,</span><br/>
<span>so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as</span><br/>
<span>an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised</span><br/>
<span>and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept</span><br/>
<span>in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar</span><br/>
<span>Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written</span><br/>
<span>by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that</span><br/>
<span>imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and</span><br/>
<span>liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of</span><br/>
<span>Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and</span><br/>
<span>never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with</span><br/>
<span>industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity,</span><br/>
<span>so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XV -- CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES,</span><br/>
<span>ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince</span><br/>
<span>towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have written on</span><br/>
<span>this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it</span><br/>
<span>again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of</span><br/>
<span>other people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall</span><br/>
<span>be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to</span><br/>
<span>follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for</span><br/>
<span>many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never</span><br/>
<span>been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one</span><br/>
<span>ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to</span><br/>
<span>be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who</span><br/>
<span>wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with</span><br/>
<span>what destroys him among so much that is evil.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know</span><br/>
<span>how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.</span><br/>
<span>Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and</span><br/>
<span>discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken</span><br/>
<span>of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable</span><br/>
<span>for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and</span><br/>
<span>thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan</span><br/>
<span>term <i>(because an avaricious person in our language is still he who</span><br/>
<span>desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives</span><br/>
<span>himself too much of the use of his own)</i>; one is reputed generous,</span><br/>
<span>one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another</span><br/>
<span>faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one</span><br/>
<span>affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere,</span><br/>
<span>another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous;</span><br/>
<span>one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every</span><br/>
<span>one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to</span><br/>
<span>exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because</span><br/>
<span>they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human</span><br/>
<span>conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently</span><br/>
<span>prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which</span><br/>
<span>would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,</span><br/>
<span>from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he</span><br/>
<span>may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need</span><br/>
<span>not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without</span><br/>
<span>which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is</span><br/>
<span>considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like</span><br/>
<span>virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which</span><br/>
<span>looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XVI -- CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say</span><br/>
<span>that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality</span><br/>
<span>exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it,</span><br/>
<span>injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be</span><br/>
<span>exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach</span><br/>
<span>of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the</span><br/>
<span>name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so</span><br/>
<span>that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property,</span><br/>
<span>and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name</span><br/>
<span>of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do</span><br/>
<span>everything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his</span><br/>
<span>subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus,</span><br/>
<span>with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is</span><br/>
<span>affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the</span><br/>
<span>first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from</span><br/>
<span>it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of</span><br/>
<span>liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if</span><br/>
<span>he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in</span><br/>
<span>time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that</span><br/>
<span>with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself</span><br/>
<span>against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without</span><br/>
<span>burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality</span><br/>
<span>towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness</span><br/>
<span>towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have</span><br/>
<span>been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was</span><br/>
<span>assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he</span><br/>
<span>did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of</span><br/>
<span>France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on</span><br/>
<span>his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long</span><br/>
<span>thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or</span><br/>
<span>conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A</span><br/>
<span>prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he</span><br/>
<span>can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he</span><br/>
<span>is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account</span><br/>
<span>a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will</span><br/>
<span>enable him to govern.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and</span><br/>
<span>many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,</span><br/>
<span>and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in</span><br/>
<span>fact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is</span><br/>
<span>dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;</span><br/>
<span>and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;</span><br/>
<span>but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his</span><br/>
<span>expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should</span><br/>
<span>reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,</span><br/>
<span>who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends</span><br/>
<span>that which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the</span><br/>
<span>first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect</span><br/>
<span>any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with</span><br/>
<span>his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that</span><br/>
<span>which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he</span><br/>
<span>would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours</span><br/>
<span>nor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and</span><br/>
<span>Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander</span><br/>
<span>that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that</span><br/>
<span>injures you.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst</span><br/>
<span>you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor</span><br/>
<span>or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a</span><br/>
<span>prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised</span><br/>
<span>and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to</span><br/>
<span>have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,</span><br/>
<span>than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to</span><br/>
<span>incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XVII -- CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS</span><br/>
<span>BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every</span><br/>
<span>prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.</span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare</span><br/>
<span>Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the</span><br/>
<span>Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this</span><br/>
<span>be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful</span><br/>
<span>than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty,</span><br/>
<span>permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.<i>(*)</i> Therefore a prince, so long as he</span><br/>
<span>keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of</span><br/>
<span>cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those</span><br/>
<span>who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow</span><br/>
<span>murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,</span><br/>
<span>whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the</span><br/>
<span>individual only.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> During the rioting between the Cancellieri and</span><br/>
<span>Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the</span><br/>
<span>imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence</span><br/>
<span>Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign</span><br/>
<span>owing to its being new, saying:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt</span><br/>
<span>Moliri, et late fines custode tueri."<i>(*)</i></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he</span><br/>
<span>himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and</span><br/>
<span>humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and</span><br/>
<span>too much distrust render him intolerable.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> . . . against my will, my fate</span><br/>
<span>A throne unsettled, and an infant state,</span><br/>
<span>Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs,</span><br/>
<span>And guard with these severities my shores.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Christopher Pitt.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than</span><br/>
<span>feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to</span><br/>
<span>be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it</span><br/>
<span>is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be</span><br/>
<span>dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that</span><br/>
<span>they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as</span><br/>
<span>you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,</span><br/>
<span>property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far</span><br/>
<span>distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that</span><br/>
<span>prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other</span><br/>
<span>precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by</span><br/>
<span>payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be</span><br/>
<span>earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied</span><br/>
<span>upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one</span><br/>
<span>who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,</span><br/>
<span>owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their</span><br/>
<span>advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never</span><br/>
<span>fails.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he</span><br/>
<span>does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well</span><br/>
<span>being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he</span><br/>
<span>abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their</span><br/>
<span>women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of</span><br/>
<span>someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,</span><br/>
<span>but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,</span><br/>
<span>because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss</span><br/>
<span>of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are</span><br/>
<span>never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always</span><br/>
<span>find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking</span><br/>
<span>life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But</span><br/>
<span>when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of</span><br/>
<span>soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation</span><br/>
<span>of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or</span><br/>
<span>disposed to its duties.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that</span><br/>
<span>having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men,</span><br/>
<span>to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or</span><br/>
<span>against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This</span><br/>
<span>arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his</span><br/>
<span>boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of</span><br/>
<span>his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not</span><br/>
<span>sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire</span><br/>
<span>his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal</span><br/>
<span>cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been</span><br/>
<span>sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most</span><br/>
<span>excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,</span><br/>
<span>against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from</span><br/>
<span>nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more</span><br/>
<span>license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was</span><br/>
<span>upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of</span><br/>
<span>the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,</span><br/>
<span>yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate</span><br/>
<span>punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in</span><br/>
<span>the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew</span><br/>
<span>much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.</span><br/>
<span>This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have</span><br/>
<span>destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the</span><br/>
<span>control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed</span><br/>
<span>itself, but contributed to his glory.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the</span><br/>
<span>conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing</span><br/>
<span>according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself</span><br/>
<span>on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must</span><br/>
<span>endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XVIII<i>(*)</i> -- CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP</span><br/>
<span>FAITH</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "The present chapter has given greater offence than any</span><br/>
<span>other portion of Machiavelli's writings." Burd, "Il</span><br/>
<span>Principe," p. 297.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and</span><br/>
<span>to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience</span><br/>
<span>has been that those princes who have done great things have held good</span><br/>
<span>faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect</span><br/>
<span>of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on</span><br/>
<span>their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,<i>(*)</i> the one</span><br/>
<span>by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the</span><br/>
<span>second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it</span><br/>
<span>is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary</span><br/>
<span>for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the</span><br/>
<span>man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,</span><br/>
<span>who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to</span><br/>
<span>the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;</span><br/>
<span>which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half</span><br/>
<span>beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make</span><br/>
<span>use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A</span><br/>
<span>prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought</span><br/>
<span>to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself</span><br/>
<span>against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.</span><br/>
<span>Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a</span><br/>
<span>lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not</span><br/>
<span>understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought</span><br/>
<span>he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and</span><br/>
<span>when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men</span><br/>
<span>were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are</span><br/>
<span>bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe</span><br/>
<span>it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate</span><br/>
<span>reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples</span><br/>
<span>could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made</span><br/>
<span>void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who</span><br/>
<span>has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Contesting," i.e. "striving for mastery." Mr Burd</span><br/>
<span>points out that this passage is imitated directly from</span><br/>
<span>Cicero's "De Officiis": "Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,</span><br/>
<span>unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud</span><br/>
<span>proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad</span><br/>
<span>posterius, si uti non licet superiore."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,</span><br/>
<span>and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and</span><br/>
<span>so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will</span><br/>
<span>always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent</span><br/>
<span>example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing</span><br/>
<span>else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he</span><br/>
<span>always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power</span><br/>
<span>in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would</span><br/>
<span>observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to</span><br/>
<span>his wishes,<i>(*)</i> because he well understood this side of mankind.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni <i>(ad</span><br/>
<span>votum)</i>." The words "ad votum" are omitted in the Testina</span><br/>
<span>addition, 1550.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Alexander never did what he said,</span><br/>
<span>Cesare never said what he did.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Italian Proverb.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities</span><br/>
<span>I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And</span><br/>
<span>I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe</span><br/>
<span>them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear</span><br/>
<span>merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a</span><br/>
<span>mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and</span><br/>
<span>know how to change to the opposite.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,</span><br/>
<span>cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often</span><br/>
<span>forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,<i>(*)</i></span><br/>
<span>friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to</span><br/>
<span>have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations</span><br/>
<span>of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the</span><br/>
<span>good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to</span><br/>
<span>set about it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Contrary to fidelity" or "faith," "contro alla fede,"</span><br/>
<span>and "tutto fede," "altogether faithful," in the next</span><br/>
<span>paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, "contro</span><br/>
<span>alla fede" and "tutto fede," were omitted in the Testina</span><br/>
<span>edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal</span><br/>
<span>authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word</span><br/>
<span>"fede" was "the faith," i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as</span><br/>
<span>rendered here "fidelity" and "faithful." Observe that the</span><br/>
<span>word "religione" was suffered to stand in the text of the</span><br/>
<span>Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of</span><br/>
<span>belief, as witness "the religion," a phrase inevitably</span><br/>
<span>employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his</span><br/>
<span>Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this passage as</span><br/>
<span>follows: "That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,</span><br/>
<span>Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his</span><br/>
<span>political scheme: 'That the show of religion was helpful to</span><br/>
<span>the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and</span><br/>
<span>pernicious.'"</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything</span><br/>
<span>slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five</span><br/>
<span>qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether</span><br/>
<span>merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing</span><br/>
<span>more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men</span><br/>
<span>judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to</span><br/>
<span>everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees</span><br/>
<span>what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare</span><br/>
<span>not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty</span><br/>
<span>of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and</span><br/>
<span>especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges</span><br/>
<span>by the result.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding</span><br/>
<span>his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be</span><br/>
<span>praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a</span><br/>
<span>thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are</span><br/>
<span>only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have</span><br/>
<span>no ground to rest on.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One prince<i>(*)</i> of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never</span><br/>
<span>preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is</span><br/>
<span>most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of</span><br/>
<span>reputation and kingdom many a time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XIX -- THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I</span><br/>
<span>have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss</span><br/>
<span>briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has</span><br/>
<span>been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him</span><br/>
<span>hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he</span><br/>
<span>will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other</span><br/>
<span>reproaches.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,</span><br/>
<span>and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from</span><br/>
<span>both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their</span><br/>
<span>honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to</span><br/>
<span>contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many</span><br/>
<span>ways.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,</span><br/>
<span>effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should</span><br/>
<span>guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his</span><br/>
<span>actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his</span><br/>
<span>private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are</span><br/>
<span>irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can</span><br/>
<span>hope either to deceive him or to get round him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,</span><br/>
<span>and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,</span><br/>
<span>provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by</span><br/>
<span>his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason</span><br/>
<span>a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his</span><br/>
<span>subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From</span><br/>
<span>the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,</span><br/>
<span>and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will</span><br/>
<span>always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they</span><br/>
<span>should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should</span><br/>
<span>affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and</span><br/>
<span>has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist</span><br/>
<span>every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has</span><br/>
<span>only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince</span><br/>
<span>can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by</span><br/>
<span>keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary</span><br/>
<span>for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most</span><br/>
<span>efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not</span><br/>
<span>to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against</span><br/>
<span>a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the</span><br/>
<span>conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have</span><br/>
<span>the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront</span><br/>
<span>a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the</span><br/>
<span>conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires</span><br/>
<span>cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he</span><br/>
<span>believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind</span><br/>
<span>to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content</span><br/>
<span>himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that,</span><br/>
<span>seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other</span><br/>
<span>to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a</span><br/>
<span>thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side</span><br/>
<span>of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of</span><br/>
<span>punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the</span><br/>
<span>majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and</span><br/>
<span>the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the</span><br/>
<span>popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to</span><br/>
<span>conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the</span><br/>
<span>execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to</span><br/>
<span>the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and</span><br/>
<span>thus cannot hope for any escape.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content</span><br/>
<span>with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer</span><br/>
<span>Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna <i>(grandfather of the</span><br/>
<span>present Annibale)</i>, having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had</span><br/>
<span>conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer</span><br/>
<span>Giovanni,<i>(*)</i> who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination</span><br/>
<span>the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the</span><br/>
<span>popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in</span><br/>
<span>Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the</span><br/>
<span>death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having</span><br/>
<span>information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence,</span><br/>
<span>who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to</span><br/>
<span>Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was</span><br/>
<span>ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan</span><br/>
<span>1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli's</span><br/>
<span>strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from</span><br/>
<span>his own very recent experience <i>(February 1513)</i>, when he had</span><br/>
<span>been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the</span><br/>
<span>Boscoli conspiracy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies</span><br/>
<span>of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it</span><br/>
<span>is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear</span><br/>
<span>everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have</span><br/>
<span>taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the</span><br/>
<span>people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important</span><br/>
<span>objects a prince can have.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and</span><br/>
<span>in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty</span><br/>
<span>and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its</span><br/>
<span>authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of</span><br/>
<span>the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths</span><br/>
<span>would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the</span><br/>
<span>hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to</span><br/>
<span>protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care</span><br/>
<span>of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be</span><br/>
<span>liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people</span><br/>
<span>for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who</span><br/>
<span>could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the</span><br/>
<span>king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or</span><br/>
<span>a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can</span><br/>
<span>draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs</span><br/>
<span>of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in</span><br/>
<span>their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish</span><br/>
<span>the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths</span><br/>
<span>of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary</span><br/>
<span>to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great</span><br/>
<span>qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been</span><br/>
<span>killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore,</span><br/>
<span>to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the</span><br/>
<span>emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different</span><br/>
<span>to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for</span><br/>
<span>consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the</span><br/>
<span>affairs of those times.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to</span><br/>
<span>the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were</span><br/>
<span>Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son</span><br/>
<span>Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the</span><br/>
<span>ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be</span><br/>
<span>contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to</span><br/>
<span>put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset</span><br/>
<span>with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing</span><br/>
<span>to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people</span><br/>
<span>loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince,</span><br/>
<span>whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and</span><br/>
<span>rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise</span><br/>
<span>upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to</span><br/>
<span>their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were</span><br/>
<span>always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great</span><br/>
<span>authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the</span><br/>
<span>principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,</span><br/>
<span>were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about</span><br/>
<span>injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes</span><br/>
<span>cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to</span><br/>
<span>avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they</span><br/>
<span>ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the</span><br/>
<span>most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had</span><br/>
<span>need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to</span><br/>
<span>the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,</span><br/>
<span>accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being</span><br/>
<span>all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,</span><br/>
<span>and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died</span><br/>
<span>honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,</span><br/>
<span>and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,</span><br/>
<span>being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept</span><br/>
<span>both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor</span><br/>
<span>despised.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,</span><br/>
<span>who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not</span><br/>
<span>endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,</span><br/>
<span>having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt</span><br/>
<span>for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his</span><br/>
<span>administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as</span><br/>
<span>much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince</span><br/>
<span>wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that</span><br/>
<span>body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it</span><br/>
<span>may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to</span><br/>
<span>submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do</span><br/>
<span>you harm.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,</span><br/>
<span>that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the</span><br/>
<span>fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by</span><br/>
<span>him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who</span><br/>
<span>allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the</span><br/>
<span>army conspired against him, and murdered him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus</span><br/>
<span>Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men</span><br/>
<span>who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of</span><br/>
<span>iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad</span><br/>
<span>end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers</span><br/>
<span>friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned</span><br/>
<span>successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of</span><br/>
<span>the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished</span><br/>
<span>and awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the</span><br/>
<span>actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show</span><br/>
<span>briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which</span><br/>
<span>natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in</span><br/>
<span>Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome</span><br/>
<span>and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian</span><br/>
<span>soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the</span><br/>
<span>throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known</span><br/>
<span>that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear,</span><br/>
<span>elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for</span><br/>
<span>Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two</span><br/>
<span>difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had</span><br/>
<span>caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where</span><br/>
<span>Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it</span><br/>
<span>dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack</span><br/>
<span>Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected</span><br/>
<span>emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and</span><br/>
<span>sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made</span><br/>
<span>Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.</span><br/>
<span>But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental</span><br/>
<span>affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus,</span><br/>
<span>little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had</span><br/>
<span>by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was</span><br/>
<span>compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and</span><br/>
<span>took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully</span><br/>
<span>examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and</span><br/>
<span>a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,</span><br/>
<span>and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a</span><br/>
<span>new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme</span><br/>
<span>renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have</span><br/>
<span>conceived against him for his violence.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent</span><br/>
<span>qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and</span><br/>
<span>acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring</span><br/>
<span>of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which</span><br/>
<span>caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and</span><br/>
<span>cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single</span><br/>
<span>murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of</span><br/>
<span>Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those</span><br/>
<span>he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst</span><br/>
<span>of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like</span><br/>
<span>deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate</span><br/>
<span>courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear</span><br/>
<span>to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because</span><br/>
<span>they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury</span><br/>
<span>to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.</span><br/>
<span>Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a</span><br/>
<span>brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained</span><br/>
<span>in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and</span><br/>
<span>proved the emperor's ruin.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to</span><br/>
<span>hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it,</span><br/>
<span>and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his</span><br/>
<span>people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave</span><br/>
<span>himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might</span><br/>
<span>indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining</span><br/>
<span>his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators,</span><br/>
<span>and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he</span><br/>
<span>fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and</span><br/>
<span>despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike</span><br/>
<span>man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,</span><br/>
<span>of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the</span><br/>
<span>throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated</span><br/>
<span>and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought</span><br/>
<span>him into contempt <i>(it being well known to all, and considered a great</span><br/>
<span>indignity by every one)</i>, and the other, his having at the accession</span><br/>
<span>to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the</span><br/>
<span>imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity</span><br/>
<span>by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,</span><br/>
<span>practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger</span><br/>
<span>at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa</span><br/>
<span>rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy</span><br/>
<span>conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,</span><br/>
<span>besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were</span><br/>
<span>disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so</span><br/>
<span>many against him, murdered him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being</span><br/>
<span>thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this</span><br/>
<span>discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this</span><br/>
<span>difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a</span><br/>
<span>far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some</span><br/>
<span>indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that</span><br/>
<span>are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were</span><br/>
<span>the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary</span><br/>
<span>to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more</span><br/>
<span>necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the</span><br/>
<span>people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him</span><br/>
<span>twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend</span><br/>
<span>the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,</span><br/>
<span>putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them</span><br/>
<span>his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the</span><br/>
<span>hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people,</span><br/>
<span>he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the</span><br/>
<span>Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it</span><br/>
<span>is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an</span><br/>
<span>hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old</span><br/>
<span>prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by</span><br/>
<span>those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this</span><br/>
<span>being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because</span><br/>
<span>there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new</span><br/>
<span>ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is</span><br/>
<span>old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary</span><br/>
<span>lord.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will</span><br/>
<span>consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been</span><br/>
<span>fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how</span><br/>
<span>it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number</span><br/>
<span>in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to</span><br/>
<span>unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for</span><br/>
<span>Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who</span><br/>
<span>was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly</span><br/>
<span>destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated</span><br/>
<span>Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread</span><br/>
<span>in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot</span><br/>
<span>imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow</span><br/>
<span>those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which</span><br/>
<span>are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper</span><br/>
<span>and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XX -- ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES</span><br/>
<span>OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their</span><br/>
<span>subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;</span><br/>
<span>others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid</span><br/>
<span>themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning</span><br/>
<span>of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown</span><br/>
<span>and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all</span><br/>
<span>of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states</span><br/>
<span>in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as</span><br/>
<span>comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather</span><br/>
<span>when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by</span><br/>
<span>arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted</span><br/>
<span>become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your</span><br/>
<span>subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be</span><br/>
<span>armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be</span><br/>
<span>handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they</span><br/>
<span>quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,</span><br/>
<span>considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and</span><br/>
<span>service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm</span><br/>
<span>them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either</span><br/>
<span>for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions</span><br/>
<span>breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it</span><br/>
<span>follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already</span><br/>
<span>shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to</span><br/>
<span>defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore,</span><br/>
<span>as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always</span><br/>
<span>distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince</span><br/>
<span>acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then</span><br/>
<span>it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have</span><br/>
<span>been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and</span><br/>
<span>opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should</span><br/>
<span>be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be</span><br/>
<span>your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed</span><br/>
<span>to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by</span><br/>
<span>fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their</span><br/>
<span>tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.</span><br/>
<span>This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way</span><br/>
<span>balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept</span><br/>
<span>for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;</span><br/>
<span>rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided</span><br/>
<span>cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always</span><br/>
<span>assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.</span><br/>
<span>The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the</span><br/>
<span>Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although</span><br/>
<span>they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these</span><br/>
<span>disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their</span><br/>
<span>differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not</span><br/>
<span>afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one</span><br/>
<span>party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,</span><br/>
<span>therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be</span><br/>
<span>permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the</span><br/>
<span>more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if</span><br/>
<span>war comes this policy proves fallacious.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the</span><br/>
<span>difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore</span><br/>
<span>fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who</span><br/>
<span>has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes</span><br/>
<span>enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have</span><br/>
<span>the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a</span><br/>
<span>ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that</span><br/>
<span>a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster</span><br/>
<span>some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown</span><br/>
<span>may rise higher.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance</span><br/>
<span>in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than</span><br/>
<span>among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince</span><br/>
<span>of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by</span><br/>
<span>others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies</span><br/>
<span>so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who</span><br/>
<span>at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of</span><br/>
<span>a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be</span><br/>
<span>gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to</span><br/>
<span>serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very</span><br/>
<span>necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had</span><br/>
<span>formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from</span><br/>
<span>them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect</span><br/>
<span>his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a</span><br/>
<span>prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he</span><br/>
<span>must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who</span><br/>
<span>did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only</span><br/>
<span>discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly</span><br/>
<span>with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy</span><br/>
<span>them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which</span><br/>
<span>can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is</span><br/>
<span>easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented</span><br/>
<span>under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of</span><br/>
<span>those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and</span><br/>
<span>encouraged him to seize it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states</span><br/>
<span>more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit</span><br/>
<span>to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge</span><br/>
<span>from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use</span><br/>
<span>of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times</span><br/>
<span>has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he</span><br/>
<span>might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to</span><br/>
<span>his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the</span><br/>
<span>foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that</span><br/>
<span>without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli</span><br/>
<span>returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,</span><br/>
<span>are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one</span><br/>
<span>way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:</span><br/>
<span>the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners</span><br/>
<span>ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners</span><br/>
<span>than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,</span><br/>
<span>built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the</span><br/>
<span>house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason</span><br/>
<span>the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,</span><br/>
<span>although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the</span><br/>
<span>people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist</span><br/>
<span>a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our</span><br/>
<span>times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the</span><br/>
<span>Countess of Forli,<i>(*)</i> when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;</span><br/>
<span>for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait</span><br/>
<span>for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture</span><br/>
<span>of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist</span><br/>
<span>the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when</span><br/>
<span>Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied</span><br/>
<span>with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then</span><br/>
<span>and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the</span><br/>
<span>fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him</span><br/>
<span>who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame</span><br/>
<span>whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and</span><br/>
<span>Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the</span><br/>
<span>Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.</span><br/>
<span>A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the</span><br/>
<span>appointment: "I have been with the signori," wrote</span><br/>
<span>Fortunati, "to learn whom they would send and when. They</span><br/>
<span>tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine</span><br/>
<span>noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me</span><br/>
<span>at once." Cf. "Catherine Sforza," by Count Pasolini,</span><br/>
<span>translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXI -- HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting</span><br/>
<span>a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present</span><br/>
<span>King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has</span><br/>
<span>risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the</span><br/>
<span>foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds</span><br/>
<span>you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the</span><br/>
<span>beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the</span><br/>
<span>foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without</span><br/>
<span>any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile</span><br/>
<span>occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;</span><br/>
<span>thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power</span><br/>
<span>and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and</span><br/>
<span>of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the</span><br/>
<span>foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.</span><br/>
<span>Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater</span><br/>
<span>schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and</span><br/>
<span>clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable</span><br/>
<span>example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,</span><br/>
<span>he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his</span><br/>
<span>achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds</span><br/>
<span>of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of</span><br/>
<span>them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other,</span><br/>
<span>that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal</span><br/>
<span>affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano,</span><br/>
<span>who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some</span><br/>
<span>extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of</span><br/>
<span>rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a</span><br/>
<span>prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain</span><br/>
<span>for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a</span><br/>
<span>downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he</span><br/>
<span>declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course</span><br/>
<span>will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two</span><br/>
<span>of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character</span><br/>
<span>that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.</span><br/>
<span>In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare</span><br/>
<span>yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if</span><br/>
<span>you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to</span><br/>
<span>the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been</span><br/>
<span>conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to</span><br/>
<span>protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want</span><br/>
<span>doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who</span><br/>
<span>loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand,</span><br/>
<span>court his fate.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive</span><br/>
<span>out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of</span><br/>
<span>the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the</span><br/>
<span>Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in</span><br/>
<span>the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to</span><br/>
<span>stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: "As for that which has</span><br/>
<span>been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not</span><br/>
<span>to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by</span><br/>
<span>not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the</span><br/>
<span>guerdon of the conqueror." Thus it will always happen that he who is not</span><br/>
<span>your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend</span><br/>
<span>will entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,</span><br/>
<span>to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are</span><br/>
<span>generally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour</span><br/>
<span>of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although</span><br/>
<span>the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is</span><br/>
<span>indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are</span><br/>
<span>never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing</span><br/>
<span>you. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not</span><br/>
<span>show some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally</span><br/>
<span>yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he</span><br/>
<span>may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that</span><br/>
<span>you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it</span><br/>
<span>greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction</span><br/>
<span>of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved</span><br/>
<span>him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your</span><br/>
<span>assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted</span><br/>
<span>that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one</span><br/>
<span>more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless</span><br/>
<span>necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are</span><br/>
<span>at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being</span><br/>
<span>at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against</span><br/>
<span>the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could</span><br/>
<span>have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the</span><br/>
<span>Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then</span><br/>
<span>in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of</span><br/>
<span>the parties.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe</span><br/>
<span>courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,</span><br/>
<span>because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid</span><br/>
<span>one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in</span><br/>
<span>knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to</span><br/>
<span>take the lesser evil.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour</span><br/>
<span>the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his</span><br/>
<span>citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and</span><br/>
<span>agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be</span><br/>
<span>deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away</span><br/>
<span>from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the</span><br/>
<span>prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and</span><br/>
<span>designs in any way to honour his city or state.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles</span><br/>
<span>at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into</span><br/>
<span>guilds or into societies,<i>(*)</i> he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and</span><br/>
<span>associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy</span><br/>
<span>and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his</span><br/>
<span>rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> "Guilds or societies," "in arti o in tribu." "Arti" were</span><br/>
<span>craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: "Arte . . . a whole</span><br/>
<span>company of any trade in any city or corporation town." The</span><br/>
<span>guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr</span><br/>
<span>Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject <i>(Methuen, 1906)</i>.</span><br/>
<span>Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called</span><br/>
<span>"artel," exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace's</span><br/>
<span>"Russia," ed. 1905: "The sons . . . were always during the</span><br/>
<span>working season members of an artel. In some of the larger</span><br/>
<span>towns there are artels of a much more complex kind--</span><br/>
<span>permanent associations, possessing large capital, and</span><br/>
<span>pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual</span><br/>
<span>members." The word "artel," despite its apparent similarity,</span><br/>
<span>has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with "ars" or</span><br/>
<span>"arte." Its root is that of the verb "rotisya," to bind</span><br/>
<span>oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only</span><br/>
<span>another form of "rota," which now signifies a "regimental</span><br/>
<span>company." In both words the underlying idea is that of a</span><br/>
<span>body of men united by an oath. "Tribu" were possibly gentile</span><br/>
<span>groups, united by common descent, and included individuals</span><br/>
<span>connected by marriage. Perhaps our words "sects" or "clans"</span><br/>
<span>would be most appropriate.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXII -- CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they</span><br/>
<span>are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the</span><br/>
<span>first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is</span><br/>
<span>by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and</span><br/>
<span>faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how</span><br/>
<span>to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are</span><br/>
<span>otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error</span><br/>
<span>which he made was in choosing them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of</span><br/>
<span>Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to</span><br/>
<span>be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there</span><br/>
<span>are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;</span><br/>
<span>another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which</span><br/>
<span>neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is</span><br/>
<span>the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,</span><br/>
<span>it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he</span><br/>
<span>was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and</span><br/>
<span>bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the</span><br/>
<span>initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant,</span><br/>
<span>and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot</span><br/>
<span>hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one</span><br/>
<span>test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his</span><br/>
<span>own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in</span><br/>
<span>everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever</span><br/>
<span>be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his</span><br/>
<span>hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and</span><br/>
<span>never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study</span><br/>
<span>him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with</span><br/>
<span>him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he</span><br/>
<span>cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,</span><br/>
<span>many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him</span><br/>
<span>dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,</span><br/>
<span>are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,</span><br/>
<span>the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXIII -- HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it</span><br/>
<span>is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless</span><br/>
<span>they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of</span><br/>
<span>whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own</span><br/>
<span>affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with</span><br/>
<span>difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they</span><br/>
<span>run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way</span><br/>
<span>of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that</span><br/>
<span>to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell</span><br/>
<span>you the truth, respect for you abates.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the</span><br/>
<span>wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking</span><br/>
<span>the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,</span><br/>
<span>and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and</span><br/>
<span>listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.</span><br/>
<span>With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry</span><br/>
<span>himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more</span><br/>
<span>freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of</span><br/>
<span>these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be</span><br/>
<span>steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown</span><br/>
<span>by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls</span><br/>
<span>into contempt.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of</span><br/>
<span>affairs to Maximilian,<i>(*)</i> the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,</span><br/>
<span>said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.</span><br/>
<span>This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the</span><br/>
<span>above; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his</span><br/>
<span>designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in</span><br/>
<span>carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are</span><br/>
<span>at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being</span><br/>
<span>pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he</span><br/>
<span>does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he</span><br/>
<span>wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the</span><br/>
<span>Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of</span><br/>
<span>Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus</span><br/>
<span>became involved in Italian politics.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he</span><br/>
<span>wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one</span><br/>
<span>from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be</span><br/>
<span>a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the</span><br/>
<span>things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any</span><br/>
<span>consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be</span><br/>
<span>felt.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression</span><br/>
<span>of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good</span><br/>
<span>advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because</span><br/>
<span>this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise</span><br/>
<span>himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his</span><br/>
<span>affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In</span><br/>
<span>this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long,</span><br/>
<span>because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from</span><br/>
<span>him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more</span><br/>
<span>than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to</span><br/>
<span>unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and</span><br/>
<span>the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And</span><br/>
<span>they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue</span><br/>
<span>to you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be</span><br/>
<span>inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of</span><br/>
<span>the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good</span><br/>
<span>counsels.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXIV -- WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince</span><br/>
<span>to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed</span><br/>
<span>in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of</span><br/>
<span>a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary</span><br/>
<span>one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind</span><br/>
<span>far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the</span><br/>
<span>present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy</span><br/>
<span>it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a</span><br/>
<span>prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double</span><br/>
<span>glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and</span><br/>
<span>strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good</span><br/>
<span>example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,</span><br/>
<span>shall lose his state by want of wisdom.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in</span><br/>
<span>Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan,</span><br/>
<span>and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in</span><br/>
<span>regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in</span><br/>
<span>the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the</span><br/>
<span>people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known</span><br/>
<span>how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that</span><br/>
<span>have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who</span><br/>
<span>was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to</span><br/>
<span>the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a</span><br/>
<span>warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he</span><br/>
<span>sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the</span><br/>
<span>end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the</span><br/>
<span>kingdom.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their</span><br/>
<span>principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own</span><br/>
<span>sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change</span><br/>
<span><i>(it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm</span><br/>
<span>against the tempest)</i>, and when afterwards the bad times came they</span><br/>
<span>thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that</span><br/>
<span>the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall</span><br/>
<span>them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to</span><br/>
<span>have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never</span><br/>
<span>wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to</span><br/>
<span>restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will</span><br/>
<span>not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which</span><br/>
<span>does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and</span><br/>
<span>durable that depend on yourself and your valour.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXV -- WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO</span><br/>
<span>WITHSTAND HER</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the</span><br/>
<span>opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by</span><br/>
<span>fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and</span><br/>
<span>that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us</span><br/>
<span>believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let</span><br/>
<span>chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times</span><br/>
<span>because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and</span><br/>
<span>may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes</span><br/>
<span>pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.</span><br/>
<span>Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that</span><br/>
<span>Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,<i>(*)</i> but that she still</span><br/>
<span>leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: "The older</span><br/>
<span>one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty</span><br/>
<span>King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this</span><br/>
<span>miserable universe." Sorel's "Eastern Question."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood</span><br/>
<span>overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away</span><br/>
<span>the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to</span><br/>
<span>its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,</span><br/>
<span>though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when</span><br/>
<span>the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences</span><br/>
<span>and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may</span><br/>
<span>pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so</span><br/>
<span>dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour</span><br/>
<span>has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where</span><br/>
<span>she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain</span><br/>
<span>her.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and</span><br/>
<span>which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open</span><br/>
<span>country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been</span><br/>
<span>defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either</span><br/>
<span>this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it</span><br/>
<span>would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning</span><br/>
<span>resistance to fortune in general.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be</span><br/>
<span>seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change</span><br/>
<span>of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes</span><br/>
<span>that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who</span><br/>
<span>relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that</span><br/>
<span>he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of</span><br/>
<span>the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will</span><br/>
<span>not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end</span><br/>
<span>which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there</span><br/>
<span>by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force,</span><br/>
<span>another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one</span><br/>
<span>succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of</span><br/>
<span>two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly,</span><br/>
<span>two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being</span><br/>
<span>cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than</span><br/>
<span>whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.</span><br/>
<span>This follows from what I have said, that two men working differently</span><br/>
<span>bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains</span><br/>
<span>his object and the other does not.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs</span><br/>
<span>himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a</span><br/>
<span>way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if</span><br/>
<span>times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course</span><br/>
<span>of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know</span><br/>
<span>how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate</span><br/>
<span>from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always</span><br/>
<span>prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well</span><br/>
<span>to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn</span><br/>
<span>adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he</span><br/>
<span>changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and</span><br/>
<span>found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action</span><br/>
<span>that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against</span><br/>
<span>Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians</span><br/>
<span>were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the</span><br/>
<span>enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless</span><br/>
<span>he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness</span><br/>
<span>and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute</span><br/>
<span>and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover</span><br/>
<span>the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of</span><br/>
<span>France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring</span><br/>
<span>to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it</span><br/>
<span>impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action</span><br/>
<span>accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have</span><br/>
<span>done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his</span><br/>
<span>plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have</span><br/>
<span>done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would</span><br/>
<span>have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a</span><br/>
<span>thousand fears.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they</span><br/>
<span>all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience</span><br/>
<span>the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go</span><br/>
<span>cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have</span><br/>
<span>deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind</span><br/>
<span>steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are</span><br/>
<span>successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider</span><br/>
<span>that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is</span><br/>
<span>a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and</span><br/>
<span>ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by</span><br/>
<span>the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is,</span><br/>
<span>therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are</span><br/>
<span>less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CHAPTER XXVI -- AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and</span><br/>
<span>wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to</span><br/>
<span>a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an</span><br/>
<span>opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of</span><br/>
<span>things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this</span><br/>
<span>country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new</span><br/>
<span>prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be</span><br/>
<span>captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians</span><br/>
<span>should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the</span><br/>
<span>soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate</span><br/>
<span>the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to</span><br/>
<span>discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy</span><br/>
<span>should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should</span><br/>
<span>be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,</span><br/>
<span>more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,</span><br/>
<span>despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us</span><br/>
<span>think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was</span><br/>
<span>afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him;</span><br/>
<span>so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal</span><br/>
<span>her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy,</span><br/>
<span>to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse</span><br/>
<span>those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God</span><br/>
<span>to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous</span><br/>
<span>insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a</span><br/>
<span>banner if only someone will raise it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope</span><br/>
<span>than in your illustrious house,<i>(*)</i> with its valour and fortune, favoured</span><br/>
<span>by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could</span><br/>
<span>be made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you</span><br/>
<span>will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.</span><br/>
<span>And although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and</span><br/>
<span>each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for</span><br/>
<span>their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was</span><br/>
<span>God more their friend than He is yours.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal</span><br/>
<span>by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the</span><br/>
<span>title of Clement VII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is</span><br/>
<span>necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in</span><br/>
<span>them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness</span><br/>
<span>is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those</span><br/>
<span>men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how</span><br/>
<span>extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:</span><br/>
<span>the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured</span><br/>
<span>forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to</span><br/>
<span>your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do</span><br/>
<span>everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory</span><br/>
<span>which belongs to us.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians</span><br/>
<span>have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious</span><br/>
<span>house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns,</span><br/>
<span>it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has</span><br/>
<span>happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us</span><br/>
<span>have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to</span><br/>
<span>establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.</span><br/>
<span>Such things when they are well founded and dignified will make him</span><br/>
<span>revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to</span><br/>
<span>bring such into use in every form.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.</span><br/>
<span>Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior</span><br/>
<span>the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes</span><br/>
<span>to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from</span><br/>
<span>the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not</span><br/>
<span>obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been</span><br/>
<span>any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune,</span><br/>
<span>that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time,</span><br/>
<span>and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there</span><br/>
<span>has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of</span><br/>
<span>itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,</span><br/>
<span>Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.<i>(*)</i></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span><i>(*)</i> The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,</span><br/>
<span>1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable</span><br/>
<span>men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,</span><br/>
<span>as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your</span><br/>
<span>own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better</span><br/>
<span>soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will</span><br/>
<span>be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,</span><br/>
<span>honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is</span><br/>
<span>necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended</span><br/>
<span>against foreigners by Italian valour.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very</span><br/>
<span>formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which</span><br/>
<span>a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied</span><br/>
<span>upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the</span><br/>
<span>Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close</span><br/>
<span>combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards</span><br/>
<span>are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by</span><br/>
<span>Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot</span><br/>
<span>be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of</span><br/>
<span>Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,</span><br/>
<span>who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility</span><br/>
<span>of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the</span><br/>
<span>Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood</span><br/>
<span>helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been</span><br/>
<span>over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both</span><br/>
<span>these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not</span><br/>
<span>be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but</span><br/>
<span>a variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which</span><br/>
<span>confer reputation and power upon a new prince.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting</span><br/>
<span>Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love</span><br/>
<span>with which he would be received in all those provinces which have</span><br/>
<span>suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for</span><br/>
<span>revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.</span><br/>
<span>What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?</span><br/>
<span>What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all</span><br/>
<span>of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious</span><br/>
<span>house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all</span><br/>
<span>just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native</span><br/>
<span>country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that</span><br/>
<span>saying of Petrarch:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Virtu contro al Furore</span><br/>
<span>Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto:</span><br/>
<span>Che l'antico valore</span><br/>
<span>Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,</span><br/>
<span>And it i' th' combat soon shall put to flight:</span><br/>
<span>For the old Roman valour is not dead,</span><br/>
<span>Nor in th' Italians' brests extinguished.</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING</span><br/>
<span>VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE</span><br/>
<span>DI GRAVINA ORSINI</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>BY</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>NICOLO MACHIAVELLI</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to</span><br/>
<span>clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been</span><br/>
<span>raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo</span><br/>
<span>and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence</span><br/>
<span>he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni</span><br/>
<span>Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city</span><br/>
<span>under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and</span><br/>
<span>their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too</span><br/>
<span>powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek</span><br/>
<span>to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon</span><br/>
<span>this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia,</span><br/>
<span>to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,</span><br/>
<span>Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant</span><br/>
<span>of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci,</span><br/>
<span>the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and courage of the</span><br/>
<span>duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise</span><br/>
<span>bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they decided not to</span><br/>
<span>abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and</span><br/>
<span>they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party</span><br/>
<span>assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the</span><br/>
<span>common enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy,</span><br/>
<span>and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the</span><br/>
<span>people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Thus it arose that, men's minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by</span><br/>
<span>certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was</span><br/>
<span>held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The</span><br/>
<span>castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;</span><br/>
<span>so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being</span><br/>
<span>carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from</span><br/>
<span>being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping</span><br/>
<span>upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being</span><br/>
<span>effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being</span><br/>
<span>encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the</span><br/>
<span>Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose</span><br/>
<span>the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town,</span><br/>
<span>should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent</span><br/>
<span>again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying</span><br/>
<span>the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they</span><br/>
<span>ought not to wait for another opportunity.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and</span><br/>
<span>Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli,</span><br/>
<span>their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against</span><br/>
<span>his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against</span><br/>
<span>everybody's expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the</span><br/>
<span>enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering</span><br/>
<span>courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize</span><br/>
<span>before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to</span><br/>
<span>negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter</span><br/>
<span>he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by</span><br/>
<span>enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort:</span><br/>
<span>to all he gave money.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached</span><br/>
<span>Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the</span><br/>
<span>aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke</span><br/>
<span>resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of</span><br/>
<span>reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in</span><br/>
<span>any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man</span><br/>
<span>who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have</span><br/>
<span>the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to</span><br/>
<span>him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a</span><br/>
<span>standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took</span><br/>
<span>every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such</span><br/>
<span>preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in</span><br/>
<span>separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there</span><br/>
<span>came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found</span><br/>
<span>himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open</span><br/>
<span>war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous</span><br/>
<span>to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of</span><br/>
<span>reconciliation.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in</span><br/>
<span>which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand</span><br/>
<span>ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed</span><br/>
<span>an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come</span><br/>
<span>personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the</span><br/>
<span>other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and</span><br/>
<span>other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and</span><br/>
<span>not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his</span><br/>
<span>permission.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,</span><br/>
<span>again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in</span><br/>
<span>his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the</span><br/>
<span>fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by</span><br/>
<span>the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.</span><br/>
<span>But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed</span><br/>
<span>his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November</span><br/>
<span>together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he</span><br/>
<span>stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini,</span><br/>
<span>who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the</span><br/>
<span>enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being</span><br/>
<span>concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke</span><br/>
<span>wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if</span><br/>
<span>he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke</span><br/>
<span>replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus</span><br/>
<span>become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to</span><br/>
<span>proceed against Sinigalia.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the</span><br/>
<span>fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give</span><br/>
<span>it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him</span><br/>
<span>to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being</span><br/>
<span>invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no</span><br/>
<span>suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French</span><br/>
<span>men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred</span><br/>
<span>lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena</span><br/>
<span>about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost</span><br/>
<span>cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for</span><br/>
<span>him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would</span><br/>
<span>cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,</span><br/>
<span>and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of</span><br/>
<span>his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of</span><br/>
<span>his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards</span><br/>
<span>trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had</span><br/>
<span>corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be</span><br/>
<span>on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most</span><br/>
<span>trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d'Euna,</span><br/>
<span>who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo,</span><br/>
<span>Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his</span><br/>
<span>followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain</span><br/>
<span>men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached</span><br/>
<span>Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the</span><br/>
<span>duke's quarters, where they should be seized.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which</span><br/>
<span>there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to</span><br/>
<span>assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from</span><br/>
<span>Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day</span><br/>
<span>of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade</span><br/>
<span>of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the</span><br/>
<span>infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of</span><br/>
<span>the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who</span><br/>
<span>goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases</span><br/>
<span>of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is</span><br/>
<span>distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot</span><br/>
<span>and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs</span><br/>
<span>a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano,</span><br/>
<span>facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for</span><br/>
<span>a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which</span><br/>
<span>passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank of it,</span><br/>
<span>and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which</span><br/>
<span>crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into</span><br/>
<span>Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before this gate</span><br/>
<span>there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of</span><br/>
<span>the river forms one side.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and</span><br/>
<span>to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant</span><br/>
<span>from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men</span><br/>
<span>of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,</span><br/>
<span>which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty</span><br/>
<span>horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters</span><br/>
<span>having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and</span><br/>
<span>when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass</span><br/>
<span>over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and</span><br/>
<span>the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through</span><br/>
<span>which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a</span><br/>
<span>few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a</span><br/>
<span>cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his</span><br/>
<span>approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the</span><br/>
<span>man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that</span><br/>
<span>when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the</span><br/>
<span>duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended</span><br/>
<span>his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that</span><br/>
<span>it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers</span><br/>
<span>that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before</span><br/>
<span>the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with</span><br/>
<span>goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned</span><br/>
<span>to look after them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in</span><br/>
<span>Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before</span><br/>
<span>his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling</span><br/>
<span>them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of</span><br/>
<span>Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that</span><br/>
<span>Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined</span><br/>
<span>Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of</span><br/>
<span>their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;</span><br/>
<span>and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come</span><br/>
<span>himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came</span><br/>
<span>before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,</span><br/>
<span>having made his obeisance, joined the others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke's quarters,</span><br/>
<span>and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them</span><br/>
<span>prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men</span><br/>
<span>of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of</span><br/>
<span>Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini</span><br/>
<span>and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the</span><br/>
<span>destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and</span><br/>
<span>bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian</span><br/>
<span>houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country</span><br/>
<span>and saved themselves.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the duke's soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the</span><br/>
<span>men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had</span><br/>
<span>not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have</span><br/>
<span>completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,</span><br/>
<span>the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into</span><br/>
<span>a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in</span><br/>
<span>keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of</span><br/>
<span>the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame</span><br/>
<span>for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di</span><br/>
<span>Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the</span><br/>
<span>pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and</span><br/>
<span>Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502, in</span><br/>
<span>the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.</span><br/>

<span>THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who</span><br/>
<span>have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,</span><br/>
<span>who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in</span><br/>
<span>their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity;</span><br/>
<span>or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have</span><br/>
<span>either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so</span><br/>
<span>mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be</span><br/>
<span>sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who</span><br/>
<span>these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody,</span><br/>
<span>and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read</span><br/>
<span>them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great</span><br/>
<span>men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such</span><br/>
<span>men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show</span><br/>
<span>her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all</span><br/>
<span>success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was</span><br/>
<span>one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in</span><br/>
<span>which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others,</span><br/>
<span>he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course</span><br/>
<span>of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his</span><br/>
<span>memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and</span><br/>
<span>fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that</span><br/>
<span>I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I</span><br/>
<span>know delight most in noble deeds.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families</span><br/>
<span>of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in</span><br/>
<span>estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son</span><br/>
<span>Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and</span><br/>
<span>for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an</span><br/>
<span>only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso</span><br/>
<span>dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live</span><br/>
<span>with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where</span><br/>
<span>he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person</span><br/>
<span>could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after</span><br/>
<span>sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called,</span><br/>
<span>had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for</span><br/>
<span>seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves</span><br/>
<span>of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something</span><br/>
<span>resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw</span><br/>
<span>the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and</span><br/>
<span>who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly</span><br/>
<span>fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to</span><br/>
<span>the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is</span><br/>
<span>customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When</span><br/>
<span>he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised</span><br/>
<span>or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves</span><br/>
<span>what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no</span><br/>
<span>children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for</span><br/>
<span>it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They</span><br/>
<span>baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As</span><br/>
<span>the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of</span><br/>
<span>wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those</span><br/>
<span>lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended</span><br/>
<span>to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his</span><br/>
<span>canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with</span><br/>
<span>this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was</span><br/>
<span>quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the</span><br/>
<span>age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer</span><br/>
<span>Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left</span><br/>
<span>off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,</span><br/>
<span>delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,</span><br/>
<span>leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled</span><br/>
<span>his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did</span><br/>
<span>turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty</span><br/>
<span>deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,</span><br/>
<span>named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,</span><br/>
<span>bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had</span><br/>
<span>often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a</span><br/>
<span>Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman</span><br/>
<span>resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most</span><br/>
<span>mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the</span><br/>
<span>top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had</span><br/>
<span>often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street</span><br/>
<span>in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far</span><br/>
<span>excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal</span><br/>
<span>authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer</span><br/>
<span>Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed</span><br/>
<span>of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater</span><br/>
<span>desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and</span><br/>
<span>asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a</span><br/>
<span>gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in</span><br/>
<span>the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and</span><br/>
<span>the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though</span><br/>
<span>he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer</span><br/>
<span>Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,</span><br/>
<span>nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and</span><br/>
<span>take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and</span><br/>
<span>in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was</span><br/>
<span>driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear</span><br/>
<span>that he would not be able to hold him much longer.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest</span><br/>
<span>to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was</span><br/>
<span>astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that</span><br/>
<span>virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true</span><br/>
<span>gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and</span><br/>
<span>could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and</span><br/>
<span>tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,</span><br/>
<span>and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what</span><br/>
<span>enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful</span><br/>
<span>modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to</span><br/>
<span>others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals,</span><br/>
<span>and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only</span><br/>
<span>by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached</span><br/>
<span>his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the</span><br/>
<span>Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the</span><br/>
<span>Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this</span><br/>
<span>expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and</span><br/>
<span>his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all</span><br/>
<span>Lombardy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he</span><br/>
<span>left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many</span><br/>
<span>friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary</span><br/>
<span>for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son</span><br/>
<span>thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died</span><br/>
<span>Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that</span><br/>
<span>goodwill which he <i>(Francesco)</i> had always shown to HIM, and to render to</span><br/>
<span>the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.</span><br/>
<span>Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of</span><br/>
<span>Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created</span><br/>
<span>a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former</span><br/>
<span>universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical</span><br/>
<span>intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the</span><br/>
<span>head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer</span><br/>
<span>Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and</span><br/>
<span>holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;</span><br/>
<span>therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his</span><br/>
<span>eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards</span><br/>
<span>he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring</span><br/>
<span>him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him</span><br/>
<span>driven out of Lucca.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,</span><br/>
<span>who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became</span><br/>
<span>their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,</span><br/>
<span>with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting</span><br/>
<span>their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into</span><br/>
<span>his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the</span><br/>
<span>Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously</span><br/>
<span>fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and</span><br/>
<span>munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days</span><br/>
<span>in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and</span><br/>
<span>Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the</span><br/>
<span>portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling</span><br/>
<span>the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione</span><br/>
<span>entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio</span><br/>
<span>with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor</span><br/>
<span>was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more</span><br/>
<span>than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who</span><br/>
<span>fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the</span><br/>
<span>headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most</span><br/>
<span>hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party</span><br/>
<span>that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined</span><br/>
<span>to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in</span><br/>
<span>the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to</span><br/>
<span>Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number</span><br/>
<span>of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against</span><br/>
<span>the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy</span><br/>
<span>withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and</span><br/>
<span>Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within</span><br/>
<span>about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse</span><br/>
<span>of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the</span><br/>
<span>enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to</span><br/>
<span>be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.</span><br/>
<span>This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking</span><br/>
<span>that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew</span><br/>
<span>over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass</span><br/>
<span>in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and</span><br/>
<span>did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other</span><br/>
<span>side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences</span><br/>
<span>of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front</span><br/>
<span>of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was</span><br/>
<span>sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided</span><br/>
<span>to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to</span><br/>
<span>his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they</span><br/>
<span>would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had</span><br/>
<span>placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his</span><br/>
<span>less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly</span><br/>
<span>the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those</span><br/>
<span>on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing</span><br/>
<span>this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight</span><br/>
<span>of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy</span><br/>
<span>him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst</span><br/>
<span>he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into</span><br/>
<span>contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged,</span><br/>
<span>whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two</span><br/>
<span>portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long</span><br/>
<span>interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more</span><br/>
<span>valiant part of Castruccio's men were opposed to the weaker part of the</span><br/>
<span>enemy's troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged;</span><br/>
<span>and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were</span><br/>
<span>arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.</span><br/>
<span>So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on</span><br/>
<span>both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found</span><br/>
<span>themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying</span><br/>
<span>their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,</span><br/>
<span>there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and</span><br/>
<span>knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had</span><br/>
<span>come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto,</span><br/>
<span>and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among</span><br/>
<span>whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was</span><br/>
<span>killed in the first onset.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it</span><br/>
<span>appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of</span><br/>
<span>power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited</span><br/>
<span>for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of</span><br/>
<span>Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the</span><br/>
<span>murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the</span><br/>
<span>sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven</span><br/>
<span>off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to</span><br/>
<span>the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a</span><br/>
<span>proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his</span><br/>
<span>son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,</span><br/>
<span>fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained</span><br/>
<span>at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to</span><br/>
<span>death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to</span><br/>
<span>hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed</span><br/>
<span>the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa</span><br/>
<span>to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own</span><br/>
<span>way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and</span><br/>
<span>put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their</span><br/>
<span>lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at</span><br/>
<span>Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese</span><br/>
<span>with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against</span><br/>
<span>him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa,</span><br/>
<span>availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.</span><br/>
<span>They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly</span><br/>
<span>in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in</span><br/>
<span>their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be</span><br/>
<span>set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him</span><br/>
<span>from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and</span><br/>
<span>with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no</span><br/>
<span>resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the</span><br/>
<span>lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,</span><br/>
<span>and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people</span><br/>
<span>that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having</span><br/>
<span>obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the</span><br/>
<span>recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of</span><br/>
<span>Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a</span><br/>
<span>treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a</span><br/>
<span>fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of</span><br/>
<span>two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained</span><br/>
<span>at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in</span><br/>
<span>a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the</span><br/>
<span>pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and</span><br/>
<span>wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the</span><br/>
<span>lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by</span><br/>
<span>the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to</span><br/>
<span>defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca</span><br/>
<span>by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco</span><br/>
<span>Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he</span><br/>
<span>was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.</span><br/>
<span>At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into</span><br/>
<span>Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that</span><br/>
<span>he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred</span><br/>
<span>horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi,</span><br/>
<span>who was held in high estimation, because of the people's love for</span><br/>
<span>the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by</span><br/>
<span>Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was</span><br/>
<span>appointed the emperor's lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans</span><br/>
<span>were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out</span><br/>
<span>of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick</span><br/>
<span>created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the</span><br/>
<span>Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to</span><br/>
<span>accept him as their lord.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian</span><br/>
<span>affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,</span><br/>
<span>who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help</span><br/>
<span>and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country,</span><br/>
<span>if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were</span><br/>
<span>Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero</span><br/>
<span>Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the</span><br/>
<span>secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of</span><br/>
<span>these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight</span><br/>
<span>in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the</span><br/>
<span>Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the</span><br/>
<span>country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country</span><br/>
<span>districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the</span><br/>
<span>men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the</span><br/>
<span>field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to</span><br/>
<span>his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces</span><br/>
<span>and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by</span><br/>
<span>the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the</span><br/>
<span>assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo</span><br/>
<span>called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own</span><br/>
<span>territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled</span><br/>
<span>to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato,</span><br/>
<span>inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines</span><br/>
<span>recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so</span><br/>
<span>powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance</span><br/>
<span>him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not</span><br/>
<span>received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited</span><br/>
<span>other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found</span><br/>
<span>their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the</span><br/>
<span>lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.</span><br/>
<span>They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a</span><br/>
<span>peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and</span><br/>
<span>compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered</span><br/>
<span>to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what</span><br/>
<span>they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater</span><br/>
<span>intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard</span><br/>
<span>the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi</span><br/>
<span>in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.</span><br/>
<span>Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he</span><br/>
<span>posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As</span><br/>
<span>it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to</span><br/>
<span>him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,</span><br/>
<span>for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to</span><br/>
<span>pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their</span><br/>
<span>former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to</span><br/>
<span>their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano</span><br/>
<span>to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find</span><br/>
<span>the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its</span><br/>
<span>inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying</span><br/>
<span>that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his</span><br/>
<span>clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they</span><br/>
<span>surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and</span><br/>
<span>put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato,</span><br/>
<span>whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not</span><br/>
<span>appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.</span><br/>
<span>He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they</span><br/>
<span>readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of</span><br/>
<span>getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for</span><br/>
<span>two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had</span><br/>
<span>made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention</span><br/>
<span>to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to</span><br/>
<span>the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences</span><br/>
<span>and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might</span><br/>
<span>aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them</span><br/>
<span>of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life</span><br/>
<span>also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to</span><br/>
<span>be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca</span><br/>
<span>with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out</span><br/>
<span>of the state.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his</span><br/>
<span>position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of</span><br/>
<span>increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could</span><br/>
<span>get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was</span><br/>
<span>his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with</span><br/>
<span>the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties</span><br/>
<span>confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had</span><br/>
<span>been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was</span><br/>
<span>Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men</span><br/>
<span>held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive</span><br/>
<span>the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to</span><br/>
<span>blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that</span><br/>
<span>of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than</span><br/>
<span>in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more</span><br/>
<span>ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to</span><br/>
<span>him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he</span><br/>
<span>would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo</span><br/>
<span>Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa,</span><br/>
<span>and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside</span><br/>
<span>the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders</span><br/>
<span>entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia,</span><br/>
<span>and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed</span><br/>
<span>the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia</span><br/>
<span>passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to</span><br/>
<span>leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him,</span><br/>
<span>making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside</span><br/>
<span>flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope</span><br/>
<span>and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great</span><br/>
<span>valour.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness</span><br/>
<span>of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The</span><br/>
<span>German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and</span><br/>
<span>tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end</span><br/>
<span>to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call</span><br/>
<span>in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the</span><br/>
<span>city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could</span><br/>
<span>apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only</span><br/>
<span>to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this</span><br/>
<span>service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any</span><br/>
<span>time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command</span><br/>
<span>at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where</span><br/>
<span>he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time</span><br/>
<span>the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that,</span><br/>
<span>without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by</span><br/>
<span>reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa</span><br/>
<span>large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.</span><br/>
<span>When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others,</span><br/>
<span>voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many</span><br/>
<span>honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the</span><br/>
<span>greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had</span><br/>
<span>the following words embroidered on its front: "I am what God wills."</span><br/>
<span>Whilst on the back was: "What God desires shall be."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could</span><br/>
<span>tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult</span><br/>
<span>in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi</span><br/>
<span>and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These</span><br/>
<span>men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the</span><br/>
<span>aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out</span><br/>
<span>some of Castruccio's officials and partisans, and killing others, they</span><br/>
<span>restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to</span><br/>
<span>Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would</span><br/>
<span>lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the</span><br/>
<span>Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his</span><br/>
<span>road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph</span><br/>
<span>cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other</span><br/>
<span>hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard</span><br/>
<span>where the Florentines' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains</span><br/>
<span>of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as</span><br/>
<span>he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He</span><br/>
<span>believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured,</span><br/>
<span>although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,</span><br/>
<span>whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence</span><br/>
<span>in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to</span><br/>
<span>attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.</span><br/>
<span>Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill</span><br/>
<span>which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a</span><br/>
<span>bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in</span><br/>
<span>general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit</span><br/>
<span>where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.</span><br/>
<span>The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the</span><br/>
<span>castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed</span><br/>
<span>by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he</span><br/>
<span>kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.</span><br/>
<span>For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified,</span><br/>
<span>he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men</span><br/>
<span>would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large</span><br/>
<span>masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not</span><br/>
<span>stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the</span><br/>
<span>immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and</span><br/>
<span>having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed</span><br/>
<span>matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted</span><br/>
<span>into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the</span><br/>
<span>castellan put to death.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the</span><br/>
<span>Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away</span><br/>
<span>from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his</span><br/>
<span>army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached</span><br/>
<span>their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the</span><br/>
<span>following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at</span><br/>
<span>night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence</span><br/>
<span>at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he</span><br/>
<span>and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in</span><br/>
<span>the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road,</span><br/>
<span>and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the</span><br/>
<span>castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of</span><br/>
<span>their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in</span><br/>
<span>possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the</span><br/>
<span>castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill</span><br/>
<span>were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to</span><br/>
<span>pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked</span><br/>
<span>by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty</span><br/>
<span>they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When</span><br/>
<span>the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was</span><br/>
<span>filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably</span><br/>
<span>mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or</span><br/>
<span>forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult</span><br/>
<span>no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time</span><br/>
<span>the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy's infantry were scattered</span><br/>
<span>or killed without having made any effective defence because of their</span><br/>
<span>unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered</span><br/>
<span>a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on</span><br/>
<span>both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their</span><br/>
<span>friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a</span><br/>
<span>decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand</span><br/>
<span>infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred</span><br/>
<span>horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole</span><br/>
<span>force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out</span><br/>
<span>with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,</span><br/>
<span>but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their</span><br/>
<span>unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the</span><br/>
<span>rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each</span><br/>
<span>man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very</span><br/>
<span>sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were</span><br/>
<span>Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all</span><br/>
<span>Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the</span><br/>
<span>Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.</span><br/>
<span>Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the</span><br/>
<span>friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not</span><br/>
<span>content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both</span><br/>
<span>sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,</span><br/>
<span>about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the</span><br/>
<span>spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding</span><br/>
<span>horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals</span><br/>
<span>in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to</span><br/>
<span>corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city</span><br/>
<span>gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators</span><br/>
<span>in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and</span><br/>
<span>Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great</span><br/>
<span>anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to</span><br/>
<span>King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he,</span><br/>
<span>knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause</span><br/>
<span>was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from</span><br/>
<span>them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his</span><br/>
<span>son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the</span><br/>
<span>pressure of Castruccio's army, owing to his being compelled to leave</span><br/>
<span>his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a</span><br/>
<span>conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,</span><br/>
<span>one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland</span><br/>
<span>should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this</span><br/>
<span>conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy</span><br/>
<span>paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few</span><br/>
<span>are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy</span><br/>
<span>Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.</span><br/>
<span>This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio</span><br/>
<span>Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering</span><br/>
<span>their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put</span><br/>
<span>him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their</span><br/>
<span>families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and</span><br/>
<span>Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy</span><br/>
<span>upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their</span><br/>
<span>opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo,</span><br/>
<span>the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose</span><br/>
<span>no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand</span><br/>
<span>infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every</span><br/>
<span>Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack</span><br/>
<span>Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on</span><br/>
<span>the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to</span><br/>
<span>succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the</span><br/>
<span>surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army</span><br/>
<span>and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from</span><br/>
<span>thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army</span><br/>
<span>which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree</span><br/>
<span>alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would</span><br/>
<span>deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to</span><br/>
<span>think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects</span><br/>
<span>of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand</span><br/>
<span>foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to</span><br/>
<span>Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand</span><br/>
<span>infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in</span><br/>
<span>the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and</span><br/>
<span>Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover,</span><br/>
<span>the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided</span><br/>
<span>their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction</span><br/>
<span>of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio's forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would</span><br/>
<span>find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own</span><br/>
<span>command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would</span><br/>
<span>have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an</span><br/>
<span>undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take</span><br/>
<span>this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the</span><br/>
<span>river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide</span><br/>
<span>expanse of land between them and the river.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to</span><br/>
<span>decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,</span><br/>
<span>having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the</span><br/>
<span>latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet</span><br/>
<span>the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the</span><br/>
<span>saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines</span><br/>
<span>commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten</span><br/>
<span>thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and</span><br/>
<span>who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five</span><br/>
<span>thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to</span><br/>
<span>issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand</span><br/>
<span>light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The</span><br/>
<span>infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the</span><br/>
<span>water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst</span><br/>
<span>the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the</span><br/>
<span>others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of</span><br/>
<span>the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over</span><br/>
<span>with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not</span><br/>
<span>move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were</span><br/>
<span>meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to</span><br/>
<span>find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for</span><br/>
<span>landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio</span><br/>
<span>had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and</span><br/>
<span>javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces</span><br/>
<span>and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the</span><br/>
<span>wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great</span><br/>
<span>confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the</span><br/>
<span>enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides</span><br/>
<span>fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers</span><br/>
<span>of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the</span><br/>
<span>Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for</span><br/>
<span>the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water</span><br/>
<span>would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged</span><br/>
<span>on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the</span><br/>
<span>same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the</span><br/>
<span>Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by</span><br/>
<span>the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,</span><br/>
<span>and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that</span><br/>
<span>both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of</span><br/>
<span>infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting;</span><br/>
<span>he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended</span><br/>
<span>to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to</span><br/>
<span>the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took</span><br/>
<span>advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.</span><br/>
<span>But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio's reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell</span><br/>
<span>back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained</span><br/>
<span>any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his</span><br/>
<span>inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the</span><br/>
<span>defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that</span><br/>
<span>when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work</span><br/>
<span>of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the</span><br/>
<span>Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder</span><br/>
<span>of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with</span><br/>
<span>lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the</span><br/>
<span>enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine</span><br/>
<span>captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in</span><br/>
<span>crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower</span><br/>
<span>down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio's army.</span><br/>
<span>But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines</span><br/>
<span>were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them</span><br/>
<span>escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were</span><br/>
<span>taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo</span><br/>
<span>Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to</span><br/>
<span>Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater,</span><br/>
<span>as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell</span><br/>
<span>twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost</span><br/>
<span>one thousand five hundred and seventy men.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his</span><br/>
<span>life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined</span><br/>
<span>all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into</span><br/>
<span>effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death</span><br/>
<span>could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the</span><br/>
<span>whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and</span><br/>
<span>overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on</span><br/>
<span>their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the</span><br/>
<span>watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;</span><br/>
<span>he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the</span><br/>
<span>first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood</span><br/>
<span>exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno,</span><br/>
<span>and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which</span><br/>
<span>he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was</span><br/>
<span>the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high</span><br/>
<span>fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove</span><br/>
<span>fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and</span><br/>
<span>addressed him as follows:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the</span><br/>
<span>midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my</span><br/>
<span>successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have</span><br/>
<span>left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,</span><br/>
<span>because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and</span><br/>
<span>Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the</span><br/>
<span>Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these</span><br/>
<span>peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more</span><br/>
<span>peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one</span><br/>
<span>more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who</span><br/>
<span>insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me</span><br/>
<span>with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time</span><br/>
<span>to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have</span><br/>
<span>never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a</span><br/>
<span>boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should</span><br/>
<span>feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been</span><br/>
<span>born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and</span><br/>
<span>capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been</span><br/>
<span>witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his</span><br/>
<span>possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and</span><br/>
<span>increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in</span><br/>
<span>order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father</span><br/>
<span>left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have</span><br/>
<span>never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind</span><br/>
<span>from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I</span><br/>
<span>leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply</span><br/>
<span>concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast</span><br/>
<span>the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under</span><br/>
<span>they government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature</span><br/>
<span>changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held</span><br/>
<span>in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.</span><br/>
<span>Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and</span><br/>
<span>deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently</span><br/>
<span>inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines,</span><br/>
<span>injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who</span><br/>
<span>will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the</span><br/>
<span>acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan</span><br/>
<span>thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their</span><br/>
<span>help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything</span><br/>
<span>but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the</span><br/>
<span>prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou</span><br/>
<span>knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms</span><br/>
<span>with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great</span><br/>
<span>defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought</span><br/>
<span>to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would</span><br/>
<span>conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make</span><br/>
<span>friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages</span><br/>
<span>and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man</span><br/>
<span>should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and</span><br/>
<span>he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to</span><br/>
<span>govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule</span><br/>
<span>they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my</span><br/>
<span>life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed</span><br/>
<span>when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And</span><br/>
<span>thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm</span><br/>
<span>and have taught thee how to keep it."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and</span><br/>
<span>Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo</span><br/>
<span>to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he</span><br/>
<span>died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no</span><br/>
<span>prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His</span><br/>
<span>obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried</span><br/>
<span>in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi</span><br/>
<span>as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long</span><br/>
<span>after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and</span><br/>
<span>only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the</span><br/>
<span>family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a</span><br/>
<span>man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own</span><br/>
<span>time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above</span><br/>
<span>the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious</span><br/>
<span>presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke</span><br/>
<span>with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,</span><br/>
<span>and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or</span><br/>
<span>snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,</span><br/>
<span>but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false</span><br/>
<span>with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he</span><br/>
<span>desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory</span><br/>
<span>that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was</span><br/>
<span>bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He</span><br/>
<span>was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear</span><br/>
<span>nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that</span><br/>
<span>the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or</span><br/>
<span>biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any</span><br/>
<span>indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered</span><br/>
<span>with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has</span><br/>
<span>listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the</span><br/>
<span>following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,</span><br/>
<span>and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had</span><br/>
<span>said: "You would not have given more than a penny." "That is true,"</span><br/>
<span>answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: "A ducat is much less</span><br/>
<span>to me." Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that</span><br/>
<span>he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: "Fisherman are willing to let</span><br/>
<span>the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few</span><br/>
<span>little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may</span><br/>
<span>catch a whale"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience</span><br/>
<span>but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live</span><br/>
<span>so sumptuously, Castruccio said: "If that be a vice than you should</span><br/>
<span>not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints." Passing through a</span><br/>
<span>street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at</span><br/>
<span>being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: "Thou shouldst not be ashamed</span><br/>
<span>when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places." A friend</span><br/>
<span>gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: "Fool, do</span><br/>
<span>you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to</span><br/>
<span>fasten." Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: "You</span><br/>
<span>are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best</span><br/>
<span>to eat," and was answered: "We are rather like the doctors who go to the</span><br/>
<span>houses of those who have the greatest need of them." Going by water from</span><br/>
<span>Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that</span><br/>
<span>sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him,</span><br/>
<span>who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he</span><br/>
<span>did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was</span><br/>
<span>worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he</span><br/>
<span>said: "When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat</span><br/>
<span>one piece of wood upon another." To a person who was boasting that he</span><br/>
<span>had read many things, Castruccio said: "He knows better than to boast</span><br/>
<span>of remembering many things." Someone bragged that he could drink much</span><br/>
<span>without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: "An ox does the</span><br/>
<span>same." Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate</span><br/>
<span>relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was</span><br/>
<span>undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: "She has not</span><br/>
<span>taken me in, I have taken her." Being also blamed for eating very dainty</span><br/>
<span>foods, he answered: "Thou dost not spend as much as I do?" and being</span><br/>
<span>told that it was true, he continued: "Then thou art more avaricious</span><br/>
<span>than I am gluttonous." Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and</span><br/>
<span>splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown</span><br/>
<span>by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones</span><br/>
<span>representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.</span><br/>
<span>Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon</span><br/>
<span>Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: "I knew not</span><br/>
<span>where to spit in order to offend thee less." Being asked how Caesar</span><br/>
<span>died he said: "God willing I will die as he did." Being one night in the</span><br/>
<span>house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was</span><br/>
<span>reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with</span><br/>
<span>them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: "He who is</span><br/>
<span>considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night." A person</span><br/>
<span>came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening</span><br/>
<span>to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply</span><br/>
<span>reproved by Castruccio, said: "Thou art the reason of my acting thus for</span><br/>
<span>thou hast thy ears in thy feet," whereupon he obtained double the favour</span><br/>
<span>he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy</span><br/>
<span>one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled</span><br/>
<span>blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous</span><br/>
<span>words, he said to him: "When you have another request to make, send</span><br/>
<span>someone else to make it." Having been wearied by a similar man with a</span><br/>
<span>long oration who wound up by saying: "Perhaps I have fatigued you by</span><br/>
<span>speaking so long," Castruccio said: "You have not, because I have not</span><br/>
<span>listened to a word you said." He used to say of one who had been a</span><br/>
<span>beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was</span><br/>
<span>dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he</span><br/>
<span>took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he</span><br/>
<span>said: "Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is</span><br/>
<span>unfortunate?" Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco</span><br/>
<span>Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: "What shall I give you if</span><br/>
<span>you will let me give you a blow on the nose?" Castruccio answered:</span><br/>
<span>"A helmet." Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been</span><br/>
<span>instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done</span><br/>
<span>wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived</span><br/>
<span>themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly</span><br/>
<span>those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying</span><br/>
<span>that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused</span><br/>
<span>when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that</span><br/>
<span>whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to</span><br/>
<span>learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with</span><br/>
<span>only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to</span><br/>
<span>be buried when he died, and answered: "With the face turned downwards,</span><br/>
<span>for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down." On</span><br/>
<span>being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to</span><br/>
<span>save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange</span><br/>
<span>to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della</span><br/>
<span>Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to</span><br/>
<span>preserve his health, and replied: "If the man be rich let him eat</span><br/>
<span>when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can." Seeing on of his</span><br/>
<span>gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: "I</span><br/>
<span>pray God that you will let him feed you also." Seeing that someone had</span><br/>
<span>written upon his house in Latin the words: "May God preserve this house</span><br/>
<span>from the wicked," he said, "The owner must never go in." Passing through</span><br/>
<span>one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and</span><br/>
<span>remarked: "That house will fly through the door." He was having a</span><br/>
<span>discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the</span><br/>
<span>property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and</span><br/>
<span>the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. "Is this king of</span><br/>
<span>yours a bad man or a good one?" asked Castruccio, and was told that he</span><br/>
<span>was a good one, whereupon he said, "Why should you suggest that I should</span><br/>
<span>be afraid of a good man?"</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and</span><br/>
<span>weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to</span><br/>
<span>his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a</span><br/>
<span>prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,</span><br/>
<span>so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;</span><br/>
<span>therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be</span><br/>
<span>seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were</span><br/>
<span>placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in</span><br/>
<span>his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of</span><br/>
<span>Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his</span><br/>
<span>age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had</span><br/>
<span>Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia</span><br/>
<span>or Rome.</span><br/>

<span>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free</span><br/>
<span>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work</span><br/>
<span><i>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg")</i>, you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>electronic works</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to</span><br/>
<span>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property</span><br/>
<span><i>(trademark/copyright)</i> agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all</span><br/>
<span>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy</span><br/>
<span>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.</span><br/>
<span>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the</span><br/>
<span>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or</span><br/>
<span>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be</span><br/>
<span>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who</span><br/>
<span>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few</span><br/>
<span>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</span><br/>
<span>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See</span><br/>
<span>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement</span><br/>
<span>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</span><br/>
<span>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation <i>("the Foundation"</span><br/>
<span>or PGLAF)</i>, owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the</span><br/>
<span>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an</span><br/>
<span>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are</span><br/>
<span>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from</span><br/>
<span>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative</span><br/>
<span>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg</span><br/>
<span>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by</span><br/>
<span>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of</span><br/>
<span>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with</span><br/>
<span>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by</span><br/>
<span>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern</span><br/>
<span>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in</span><br/>
<span>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check</span><br/>
<span>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement</span><br/>
<span>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or</span><br/>
<span>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning</span><br/>
<span>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United</span><br/>
<span>States.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate</span><br/>
<span>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently</span><br/>

<span>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg" is associated)</i> is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,</span><br/>
<span>copied or distributed:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with</span><br/>
<span>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or</span><br/>
<span>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included</span><br/>
<span>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived</span><br/>
<span>from the public domain <i>(does not contain a notice indicating that it is</span><br/>
<span>posted with permission of the copyright holder)</i>, the work can be copied</span><br/>
<span>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees</span><br/>
<span>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work</span><br/>
<span>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the</span><br/>
<span>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1</span><br/>
<span>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the</span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or</span><br/>
<span>1.E.9.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted</span><br/>
<span>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution</span><br/>
<span>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional</span><br/>
<span>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked</span><br/>

<span>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this</span><br/>
<span>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this</span><br/>
<span>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without</span><br/>
<span>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with</span><br/>
<span>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm License.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,</span><br/>
<span>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any</span><br/>
<span>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or</span><br/>
<span>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than</span><br/>
<span>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version</span><br/>
<span>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site <i>(www.gutenberg.org)</i>,</span><br/>
<span>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a</span><br/>
<span>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon</span><br/>
<span>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other</span><br/>
<span>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,</span><br/>
<span>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works</span><br/>
<span>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing</span><br/>
<span>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided</span><br/>
<span>that</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from</span><br/>
<span>the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method</span><br/>
<span>you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is</span><br/>
<span>owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he</span><br/>
<span>has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the</span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments</span><br/>
<span>must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you</span><br/>
<span>prepare <i>(or are legally required to prepare)</i> your periodic tax</span><br/>
<span>returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and</span><br/>
<span>sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the</span><br/>
<span>address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to</span><br/>
<span>the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies</span><br/>
<span>you in writing <i>(or by e-mail)</i> within 30 days of receipt that s/he</span><br/>
<span>does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>License.  You must require such a user to return or</span><br/>
<span>destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium</span><br/>
<span>and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of</span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm works.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any</span><br/>
<span>money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the</span><br/>
<span>electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days</span><br/>
<span>of receipt of the work.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free</span><br/>
<span>distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set</span><br/>
<span>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from</span><br/>
<span>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael</span><br/>
<span>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the</span><br/>
<span>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable</span><br/>
<span>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread</span><br/>
<span>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</span><br/>
<span>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain</span><br/>
<span>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or</span><br/>
<span>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual</span><br/>
<span>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a</span><br/>
<span>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by</span><br/>
<span>your equipment.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right</span><br/>
<span>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all</span><br/>
<span>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal</span><br/>
<span>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT</span><br/>
<span>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE</span><br/>
<span>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE</span><br/>
<span>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE</span><br/>
<span>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR</span><br/>
<span>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</span><br/>
<span>DAMAGE.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a</span><br/>
<span>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can</span><br/>
<span>receive a refund of the money <i>(if any)</i> you paid for it by sending a</span><br/>
<span>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you</span><br/>
<span>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with</span><br/>
<span>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with</span><br/>
<span>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a</span><br/>
<span>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity</span><br/>
<span>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to</span><br/>
<span>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy</span><br/>
<span>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further</span><br/>
<span>opportunities to fix the problem.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth</span><br/>
<span>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER</span><br/>
<span>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO</span><br/>
<span>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied</span><br/>
<span>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.</span><br/>
<span>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the</span><br/>
<span>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be</span><br/>
<span>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by</span><br/>
<span>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any</span><br/>
<span>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the</span><br/>
<span>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone</span><br/>
<span>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance</span><br/>
<span>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,</span><br/>
<span>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,</span><br/>
<span>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,</span><br/>
<span>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do</span><br/>
<span>or cause to occur: <i>(a)</i> distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>work, <i>(b)</i> alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any</span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and <i>(c)</i> any Defect you cause.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of</span><br/>
<span>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers</span><br/>
<span>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists</span><br/>
<span>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from</span><br/>
<span>people in all walks of life.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</span><br/>
<span>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's</span><br/>
<span>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will</span><br/>
<span>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</span><br/>
<span>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.</span><br/>
<span>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span><br/>

<span>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</span><br/>
<span>Literary Archive Foundation</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide</span><br/>

<span>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</span><br/>
<span>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest</span><br/>

<span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</span><br/>
<span>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</span><br/>
<span>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</span><br/>
<span>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</span><br/>
<span>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations</span><br/>
<span>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To</span><br/>
<span>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any</span><br/>
<span>particular state visit http://pglaf.org</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</span><br/>
<span>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</span><br/>
<span>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</span><br/>
<span>approach us with offers to donate.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</span><br/>
<span>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</span><br/>
<span>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation</span><br/>
<span>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other</span><br/>
<span>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.</span><br/>
<span>To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</span><br/>

<span>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic</span><br/>
<span>works.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm</span><br/>
<span>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared</span><br/>
<span>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project</span><br/>
<span>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed</span><br/>
<span>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.</span><br/>
<span>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily</span><br/>
<span>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>http://www.gutenberg.org</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,</span><br/>
<span>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</span><br/>
<span>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</span><br/>
<span>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</span><br/>
