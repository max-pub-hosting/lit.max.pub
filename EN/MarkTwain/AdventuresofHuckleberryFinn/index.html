<h1>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</h1><h2>Mark Twain</h1><article><p>
<i>IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary “Pike County” dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.</i><br/>
<i>I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.</i><br/>

<span># CHAPTER I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>YOU don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The</span><br/>
<span>Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter.  That book was made</span><br/>
<span>by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things</span><br/>
<span>which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I</span><br/>
<span>never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt</span><br/>
<span>Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom’s Aunt Polly, she</span><br/>
<span>is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which</span><br/>
<span>is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money</span><br/>
<span>that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six</span><br/>
<span>thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when</span><br/>
<span>it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out</span><br/>
<span>at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year</span><br/>
<span>round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas</span><br/>
<span>she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was</span><br/>
<span>rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular</span><br/>
<span>and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand</span><br/>
<span>it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead</span><br/>
<span>again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and</span><br/>
<span>said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I</span><br/>
<span>would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she</span><br/>
<span>called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by</span><br/>
<span>it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but</span><br/>
<span>sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing</span><br/>
<span>commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come</span><br/>
<span>to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but</span><br/>
<span>you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little</span><br/>
<span>over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with</span><br/>
<span>them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a</span><br/>
<span>barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the</span><br/>
<span>juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the</span><br/>
<span>Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and</span><br/>
<span>by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so</span><br/>
<span>then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in</span><br/>
<span>dead people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must</span><br/>
<span>try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They</span><br/>
<span>get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.  Here she was</span><br/>
<span>a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,</span><br/>
<span>being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a</span><br/>
<span>thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that</span><br/>
<span>was all right, because she done it herself.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,</span><br/>
<span>had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a</span><br/>
<span>spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then</span><br/>
<span>the widow made her ease up.  I couldn’t stood it much longer.  Then for</span><br/>
<span>an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,</span><br/>
<span>“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up</span><br/>
<span>like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would</span><br/>
<span>say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don’t you try to</span><br/>
<span>behave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished</span><br/>
<span>I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm.  All I wanted</span><br/>
<span>was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.</span><br/>
<span>She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for</span><br/>
<span>the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.</span><br/>
<span>Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I</span><br/>
<span>made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it.  But I never said so, because it</span><br/>
<span>would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good</span><br/>
<span>place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all</span><br/>
<span>day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn’t think</span><br/>
<span>much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer</span><br/>
<span>would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad</span><br/>
<span>about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.</span><br/>
<span>By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then</span><br/>
<span>everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,</span><br/>
<span>and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and</span><br/>
<span>tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use.  I felt</span><br/>
<span>so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the</span><br/>
<span>leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away</span><br/>
<span>off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a</span><br/>
<span>dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying</span><br/>
<span>to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so</span><br/>
<span>it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard</span><br/>
<span>that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about</span><br/>
<span>something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so</span><br/>
<span>can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night</span><br/>
<span>grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some</span><br/>
<span>company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I</span><br/>
<span>flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it</span><br/>
<span>was all shriveled up.  I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was</span><br/>
<span>an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared</span><br/>
<span>and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my</span><br/>
<span>tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied</span><br/>
<span>up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But</span><br/>
<span>I hadn’t no confidence.  You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that</span><br/>
<span>you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever</span><br/>
<span>heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed</span><br/>
<span>a spider.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;</span><br/>
<span>for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town</span><br/>
<span>go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than</span><br/>
<span>ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the</span><br/>
<span>trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I</span><br/>
<span>could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there.  That was good!</span><br/>
<span>Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the</span><br/>
<span>light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped</span><br/>
<span>down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,</span><br/>
<span>there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># CHAPTER II</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of</span><br/>
<span>the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our</span><br/>
<span>heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made</span><br/>
<span>a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson’s big nigger,</span><br/>
<span>named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty</span><br/>
<span>clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched</span><br/>
<span>his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who dah?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right</span><br/>
<span>between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was</span><br/>
<span>minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close</span><br/>
<span>together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I</span><br/>
<span>dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,</span><br/>
<span>right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.</span><br/>
<span>Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with</span><br/>
<span>the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t</span><br/>
<span>sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why</span><br/>
<span>you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.</span><br/>
<span>Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do:  I’s gwyne to set down here and</span><br/>
<span>listen tell I hears it agin.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up</span><br/>
<span>against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched</span><br/>
<span>one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into</span><br/>
<span>my eyes.  But I dasn’t scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.</span><br/>
<span>Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn’t know how I was going to set</span><br/>
<span>still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but</span><br/>
<span>it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different</span><br/>
<span>places now.  I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer,</span><br/>
<span>but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun</span><br/>
<span>to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon</span><br/>
<span>comfortable again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we</span><br/>
<span>went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom</span><br/>
<span>whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said</span><br/>
<span>no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I</span><br/>
<span>warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip</span><br/>
<span>in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn’t want him to try.  I said Jim</span><br/>
<span>might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there</span><br/>
<span>and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.</span><br/>
<span>Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do</span><br/>
<span>Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play</span><br/>
<span>something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was</span><br/>
<span>so still and lonesome.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,</span><br/>
<span>and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of</span><br/>
<span>the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it</span><br/>
<span>on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.</span><br/>
<span>Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,</span><br/>
<span>and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,</span><br/>
<span>and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told</span><br/>
<span>it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every</span><br/>
<span>time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they</span><br/>
<span>rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back</span><br/>
<span>was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he</span><br/>
<span>got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come</span><br/>
<span>miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any</span><br/>
<span>nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths</span><br/>
<span>open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is</span><br/>
<span>always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but</span><br/>
<span>whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,</span><br/>
<span>Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know ‘bout witches?” and</span><br/>
<span>that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept</span><br/>
<span>that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a</span><br/>
<span>charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could</span><br/>
<span>cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by</span><br/>
<span>saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.</span><br/>
<span>Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they</span><br/>
<span>had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch</span><br/>
<span>it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for</span><br/>
<span>a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil</span><br/>
<span>and been rode by witches.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down</span><br/>
<span>into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where</span><br/>
<span>there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever</span><br/>
<span>so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and</span><br/>
<span>awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and</span><br/>
<span>Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.</span><br/>
<span>So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,</span><br/>
<span>to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the</span><br/>
<span>secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest</span><br/>
<span>part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our</span><br/>
<span>hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave</span><br/>
<span>opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked</span><br/>
<span>under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.  We</span><br/>
<span>went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and</span><br/>
<span>sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.</span><br/>
<span>Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name</span><br/>
<span>in blood.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had</span><br/>
<span>wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the</span><br/>
<span>band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to</span><br/>
<span>any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and</span><br/>
<span>his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he</span><br/>
<span>had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign</span><br/>
<span>of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that</span><br/>
<span>mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be</span><br/>
<span>killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he</span><br/>
<span>must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the</span><br/>
<span>ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with</span><br/>
<span>blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it</span><br/>
<span>and be forgot forever.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got</span><br/>
<span>it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of</span><br/>
<span>pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had</span><br/>
<span>it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told</span><br/>
<span>the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote</span><br/>
<span>it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ‘bout</span><br/>
<span>him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days.  He</span><br/>
<span>used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen</span><br/>
<span>in these parts for a year or more.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they</span><br/>
<span>said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of</span><br/>
<span>anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready</span><br/>
<span>to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss</span><br/>
<span>Watson--they could kill her.  Everybody said:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, she’ll do.  That’s all right.  Huck can come in.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,</span><br/>
<span>and I made my mark on the paper.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”</span><br/>
<span>says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain’t burglars.  That ain’t no sort of style.  We</span><br/>
<span>are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks</span><br/>
<span>on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Must we always kill the people?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, certainly.  It’s best.  Some authorities think different, but</span><br/>
<span>mostly it’s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to</span><br/>
<span>the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ransomed?  What’s that?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know.  But that’s what they do.  I’ve seen it in books; and so</span><br/>
<span>of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it.  Don’t I tell you it’s in the</span><br/>
<span>books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,</span><br/>
<span>and get things all muddled up?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation</span><br/>
<span>are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it</span><br/>
<span>to them?--that’s the thing I want to get at.  Now, what do you reckon it</span><br/>
<span>is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I don’t know.  But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,</span><br/>
<span>it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now, that’s something _like_.  That’ll answer.  Why couldn’t you said</span><br/>
<span>that before?  We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a</span><br/>
<span>bothersome lot they’ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying</span><br/>
<span>to get loose.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when there’s a guard</span><br/>
<span>over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A guard!  Well, that _is_ good.  So somebody’s got to set up all night</span><br/>
<span>and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I think that’s</span><br/>
<span>foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as</span><br/>
<span>they get here?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because it ain’t in the books so--that’s why.  Now, Ben Rogers, do you</span><br/>
<span>want to do things regular, or don’t you?--that’s the idea.  Don’t you</span><br/>
<span>reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct</span><br/>
<span>thing to do?  Do you reckon _you_ can learn ‘em anything?  Not by a good</span><br/>
<span>deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right.  I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow.  Say, do</span><br/>
<span>we kill the women, too?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on.  Kill</span><br/>
<span>the women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.  You</span><br/>
<span>fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them;</span><br/>
<span>and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any</span><br/>
<span>more.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.</span><br/>
<span>Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows</span><br/>
<span>waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.</span><br/>
<span>But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was</span><br/>
<span>scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t</span><br/>
<span>want to be a robber any more.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him</span><br/>
<span>mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  But</span><br/>
<span>Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and</span><br/>
<span>meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted</span><br/>
<span>to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it</span><br/>
<span>on Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They agreed to get together and</span><br/>
<span>fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first</span><br/>
<span>captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was</span><br/>
<span>breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was</span><br/>
<span>dog-tired.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># CHAPTER III</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on</span><br/>
<span>account of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleaned</span><br/>
<span>off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would</span><br/>
<span>behave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet</span><br/>
<span>and prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray every day, and</span><br/>
<span>whatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn’t so.  I tried it.</span><br/>
<span>Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn’t any good to me without</span><br/>
<span>hooks.  I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to</span><br/>
<span>try for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why, and I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t make it out no way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.</span><br/>
<span>I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t</span><br/>
<span>Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?  Why can’t the widow get</span><br/>
<span>back her silver snuffbox that was stole?  Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?</span><br/>
<span>No, says I to my self, there ain’t nothing in it.  I went and told the</span><br/>
<span>widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for</span><br/>
<span>it was “spiritual gifts.”  This was too many for me, but she told me</span><br/>
<span>what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for</span><br/>
<span>other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about</span><br/>
<span>myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.  I went out in the</span><br/>
<span>woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no</span><br/>
<span>advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned</span><br/>
<span>I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the</span><br/>
<span>widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make</span><br/>
<span>a body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold</span><br/>
<span>and knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two</span><br/>
<span>Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the</span><br/>
<span>widow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help</span><br/>
<span>for him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong</span><br/>
<span>to the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he was</span><br/>
<span>a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was</span><br/>
<span>so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable</span><br/>
<span>for me; I didn’t want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me</span><br/>
<span>when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take</span><br/>
<span>to the woods most of the time when he was around.  Well, about this time</span><br/>
<span>he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so</span><br/>
<span>people said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was</span><br/>
<span>just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all</span><br/>
<span>like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, because it had</span><br/>
<span>been in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all.  They said</span><br/>
<span>he was floating on his back in the water.  They took him and buried him</span><br/>
<span>on the bank.  But I warn’t comfortable long, because I happened to think</span><br/>
<span>of something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don’t float on</span><br/>
<span>his back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but</span><br/>
<span>a woman dressed up in a man’s clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.</span><br/>
<span>I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All</span><br/>
<span>the boys did.  We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any people, but</span><br/>
<span>only just pretended.  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging</span><br/>
<span>down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,</span><br/>
<span>but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”</span><br/>
<span>and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to the</span><br/>
<span>cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed</span><br/>
<span>and marked.  But I couldn’t see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a</span><br/>
<span>boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan</span><br/>
<span><i>(which was the sign for the Gang to get together)</i>, and then he said he</span><br/>
<span>had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish</span><br/>
<span>merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two</span><br/>
<span>hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “sumter”</span><br/>
<span>mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t have only a guard</span><br/>
<span>of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called</span><br/>
<span>it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we must slick up</span><br/>
<span>our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after even a</span><br/>
<span>turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,</span><br/>
<span>though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them</span><br/>
<span>till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more</span><br/>
<span>than what they was before.  I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd</span><br/>
<span>of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,</span><br/>
<span>so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got</span><br/>
<span>the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn’t</span><br/>
<span>no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants.</span><br/>
<span>It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class</span><br/>
<span>at that.  We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we</span><br/>
<span>never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got</span><br/>
<span>a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the</span><br/>
<span>teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said there was</span><br/>
<span>loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,</span><br/>
<span>and elephants and things.  I said, why couldn’t we see them, then?  He</span><br/>
<span>said if I warn’t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I</span><br/>
<span>would know without asking.  He said it was all done by enchantment.  He</span><br/>
<span>said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,</span><br/>
<span>and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had</span><br/>
<span>turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.</span><br/>
<span>I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the</span><br/>
<span>magicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they</span><br/>
<span>would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.  They</span><br/>
<span>are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help _us_--can’t we lick</span><br/>
<span>the other crowd then?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How you going to get them?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know.  How do _they_ get them?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies</span><br/>
<span>come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the</span><br/>
<span>smoke a-rolling, and everything they’re told to do they up and do it.</span><br/>
<span>They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and</span><br/>
<span>belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any</span><br/>
<span>other man.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who makes them tear around so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to whoever rubs</span><br/>
<span>the lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he says.  If he</span><br/>
<span>tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds, and fill</span><br/>
<span>it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor’s</span><br/>
<span>daughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to do it--and they’ve</span><br/>
<span>got to do it before sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they’ve got</span><br/>
<span>to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you</span><br/>
<span>understand.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping</span><br/>
<span>the palace themselves ‘stead of fooling them away like that.  And what’s</span><br/>
<span>more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would</span><br/>
<span>drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you’d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,</span><br/>
<span>whether you wanted to or not.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All right, then;</span><br/>
<span>I _would_ come; but I lay I’d make that man climb the highest tree there</span><br/>
<span>was in the country.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don’t seem to</span><br/>
<span>know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I</span><br/>
<span>would see if there was anything in it.  I got an old tin lamp and an</span><br/>
<span>iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat</span><br/>
<span>like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t</span><br/>
<span>no use, none of the genies come.  So then I judged that all that stuff</span><br/>
<span>was only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies.  I reckoned he believed in the</span><br/>
<span>A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all</span><br/>
<span>the marks of a Sunday-school.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter IV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter</span><br/>
<span>now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and</span><br/>
<span>write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six</span><br/>
<span>times seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get any</span><br/>
<span>further than that if I was to live forever.  I don’t take no stock in</span><br/>
<span>mathematics, anyway.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.</span><br/>
<span>Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next</span><br/>
<span>day done me good and cheered me up.  So the longer I went to school the</span><br/>
<span>easier it got to be.  I was getting sort of used to the widow’s ways,</span><br/>
<span>too, and they warn’t so raspy on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in</span><br/>
<span>a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I</span><br/>
<span>used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a</span><br/>
<span>rest to me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the</span><br/>
<span>new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but</span><br/>
<span>sure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn’t ashamed of me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.</span><br/>
<span>I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left</span><br/>
<span>shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,</span><br/>
<span>and crossed me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what</span><br/>
<span>a mess you are always making!”  The widow put in a good word for me, but</span><br/>
<span>that warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.</span><br/>
<span>I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and</span><br/>
<span>wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.</span><br/>
<span>There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t one</span><br/>
<span>of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along</span><br/>
<span>low-spirited and on the watch-out.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go</span><br/>
<span>through the high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the</span><br/>
<span>ground, and I seen somebody’s tracks.  They had come up from the quarry</span><br/>
<span>and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden</span><br/>
<span>fence.  It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing around so.  I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to</span><br/>
<span>follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>notice anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left</span><br/>
<span>boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked over my</span><br/>
<span>shoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody.  I was at Judge</span><br/>
<span>Thatcher’s as quick as I could get there.  He said:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for your</span><br/>
<span>interest?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty</span><br/>
<span>dollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let me invest it</span><br/>
<span>along with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll spend it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it.  I don’t want it at</span><br/>
<span>all--nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take it; I want to give</span><br/>
<span>it to you--the six thousand and all.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked surprised.  He couldn’t seem to make it out.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please.  You’ll take</span><br/>
<span>it--won’t you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’m puzzled.  Is something the matter?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing--then I won’t have to</span><br/>
<span>tell no lies.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He studied a while, and then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not</span><br/>
<span>give it.  That’s the correct idea.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’  That means I have bought</span><br/>
<span>it of you and paid you for it.  Here’s a dollar for you.  Now you sign</span><br/>
<span>it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I signed it, and left.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Miss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which</span><br/>
<span>had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do</span><br/>
<span>magic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed</span><br/>
<span>everything.  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here</span><br/>
<span>again, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted to know was,</span><br/>
<span>what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his</span><br/>
<span>hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped</span><br/>
<span>it on the floor.  It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.</span><br/>
<span>Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.</span><br/>
<span>Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.</span><br/>
<span>But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t talk. He said sometimes it</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit</span><br/>
<span>quarter that warn’t no good because the brass showed through the silver</span><br/>
<span>a little, and it wouldn’t pass nohow, even if the brass didn’t show,</span><br/>
<span>because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it</span><br/>
<span>every time.  <i>(I reckoned I wouldn’t say nothing about the dollar I got</span><br/>
<span>from the judge.)</i> I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball</span><br/>
<span>would take it, because maybe it wouldn’t know the difference.  Jim smelt</span><br/>
<span>it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball</span><br/>
<span>would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato</span><br/>
<span>and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next</span><br/>
<span>morning you couldn’t see no brass, and it wouldn’t feel greasy no more,</span><br/>
<span>and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.</span><br/>
<span>Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened</span><br/>
<span>again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.  He said it</span><br/>
<span>would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I says, go on.  So the</span><br/>
<span>hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do.  Sometimes he</span><br/>
<span>spec he’ll go ‘way, en den agin he spec he’ll stay.  De bes’ way is to</span><br/>
<span>res’ easy en let de ole man take his own way.  Dey’s two angels hoverin’</span><br/>
<span>roun’ ‘bout him.  One uv ‘em is white en shiny, en t’other one is black.</span><br/>
<span>De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail</span><br/>
<span>in en bust it all up.  A body can’t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch</span><br/>
<span>him at de las’.  But you is all right.  You gwyne to have considable</span><br/>
<span>trouble in yo’ life, en considable joy.  Sometimes you gwyne to git</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his</span><br/>
<span>own self!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter V.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he was.  I used</span><br/>
<span>to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  I reckoned I</span><br/>
<span>was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after</span><br/>
<span>the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being</span><br/>
<span>so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn’t scared of him worth</span><br/>
<span>bothring about.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and tangled and</span><br/>
<span>greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through</span><br/>
<span>like he was behind vines.  It was all black, no gray; so was his long,</span><br/>
<span>mixed-up whiskers.  There warn’t no color in his face, where his face</span><br/>
<span>showed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a white to make</span><br/>
<span>a body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a</span><br/>
<span>fish-belly white.  As for his clothes--just rags, that was all.  He had</span><br/>
<span>one ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and</span><br/>
<span>two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat</span><br/>
<span>was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like</span><br/>
<span>a lid.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair</span><br/>
<span>tilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I noticed the window was</span><br/>
<span>up; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He kept a-looking me all over.  By</span><br/>
<span>and by he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Starchy clothes--very.  You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug,</span><br/>
<span>_don’t_ you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he.  “You’ve put on</span><br/>
<span>considerable many frills since I been away.  I’ll take you down a peg</span><br/>
<span>before I get done with you.  You’re educated, too, they say--can read and</span><br/>
<span>write.  You think you’re better’n your father, now, don’t you, because</span><br/>
<span>he can’t?  _I’ll_ take it out of you.  Who told you you might meddle</span><br/>
<span>with such hifalut’n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The widow.  She told me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel</span><br/>
<span>about a thing that ain’t none of her business?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nobody never told her.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here--you drop that</span><br/>
<span>school, you hear?  I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs</span><br/>
<span>over his own father and let on to be better’n what _he_ is.  You lemme</span><br/>
<span>catch you fooling around that school again, you hear?  Your mother</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t read, and she couldn’t write, nuther, before she died.  None</span><br/>
<span>of the family couldn’t before _they_ died.  I can’t; and here you’re</span><br/>
<span>a-swelling yourself up like this.  I ain’t the man to stand it--you hear?</span><br/>
<span>Say, lemme hear you read.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the</span><br/>
<span>wars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack</span><br/>
<span>with his hand and knocked it across the house.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky</span><br/>
<span>here; you stop that putting on frills.  I won’t have it.  I’ll lay for</span><br/>
<span>you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I’ll tan you good.</span><br/>
<span>First you know you’ll get religion, too.  I never see such a son.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s this?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He tore it up, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll give you something better--I’ll give you a cowhide.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Ain’t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and</span><br/>
<span>a look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father</span><br/>
<span>got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.  I never see such a son.  I</span><br/>
<span>bet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you.</span><br/>
<span>Why, there ain’t no end to your airs--they say you’re rich.  Hey?--how’s</span><br/>
<span>that?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They lie--that’s how.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I can</span><br/>
<span>stand now--so don’t gimme no sass.  I’ve been in town two days, and I</span><br/>
<span>hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich.  I heard about it</span><br/>
<span>away down the river, too.  That’s why I come.  You git me that money</span><br/>
<span>to-morrow--I want it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t got no money.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a lie.  Judge Thatcher’s got it.  You git it.  I want it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher; he’ll tell</span><br/>
<span>you the same.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right.  I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him pungle, too, or I’ll know</span><br/>
<span>the reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?  I want it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It don’t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it</span><br/>
<span>out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was</span><br/>
<span>going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.</span><br/>
<span>When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed</span><br/>
<span>me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I</span><br/>
<span>reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me</span><br/>
<span>to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick</span><br/>
<span>me if I didn’t drop that.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and bullyragged</span><br/>
<span>him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t, and then</span><br/>
<span>he swore he’d make the law force him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away</span><br/>
<span>from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that</span><br/>
<span>had just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t</span><br/>
<span>interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d druther</span><br/>
<span>not take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow</span><br/>
<span>had to quit on the business.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest.  He said he’d cowhide</span><br/>
<span>me till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money for him.  I</span><br/>
<span>borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got</span><br/>
<span>drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying</span><br/>
<span>on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;</span><br/>
<span>then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed</span><br/>
<span>him again for a week.  But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss</span><br/>
<span>of his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.</span><br/>
<span>So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and</span><br/>
<span>had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just</span><br/>
<span>old pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him about</span><br/>
<span>temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d been</span><br/>
<span>a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over</span><br/>
<span>a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he hoped the</span><br/>
<span>judge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could</span><br/>
<span>hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap</span><br/>
<span>said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the</span><br/>
<span>judge said he believed it.  The old man said that what a man wanted</span><br/>
<span>that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried</span><br/>
<span>again.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his</span><br/>
<span>hand, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.</span><br/>
<span>There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more; it’s</span><br/>
<span>the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll die before</span><br/>
<span>he’ll go back.  You mark them words--don’t forget I said them.  It’s a</span><br/>
<span>clean hand now; shake it--don’t be afeard.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The</span><br/>
<span>judge’s wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made</span><br/>
<span>his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something</span><br/>
<span>like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was</span><br/>
<span>the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and</span><br/>
<span>clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his</span><br/>
<span>new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old</span><br/>
<span>time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and</span><br/>
<span>rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most</span><br/>
<span>froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come</span><br/>
<span>to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could</span><br/>
<span>navigate it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform</span><br/>
<span>the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter VI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went</span><br/>
<span>for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he</span><br/>
<span>went for me, too, for not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of</span><br/>
<span>times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged</span><br/>
<span>him or outrun him most of the time.  I didn’t want to go to school much</span><br/>
<span>before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap.  That law trial was a</span><br/>
<span>slow business--appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it;</span><br/>
<span>so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge</span><br/>
<span>for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he</span><br/>
<span>got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and</span><br/>
<span>every time he raised Cain he got jailed.  He was just suited--this kind</span><br/>
<span>of thing was right in his line.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at</span><br/>
<span>last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble</span><br/>
<span>for him. Well, _wasn’t_ he mad?  He said he would show who was Huck</span><br/>
<span>Finn’s boss.  So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and</span><br/>
<span>catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and</span><br/>
<span>crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t</span><br/>
<span>no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick</span><br/>
<span>you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.</span><br/>
<span>We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the</span><br/>
<span>key under his head nights.  He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,</span><br/>
<span>and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  Every little</span><br/>
<span>while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the</span><br/>
<span>ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got</span><br/>
<span>drunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where</span><br/>
<span>I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but</span><br/>
<span>pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I was</span><br/>
<span>used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking</span><br/>
<span>and fishing, and no books nor study.  Two months or more run along, and</span><br/>
<span>my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever</span><br/>
<span>got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat on</span><br/>
<span>a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever</span><br/>
<span>bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the</span><br/>
<span>time.  I didn’t want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because</span><br/>
<span>the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>no objections.  It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it</span><br/>
<span>all around.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand</span><br/>
<span>it. I was all over welts.  He got to going away so much, too, and</span><br/>
<span>locking me in.  Once he locked me in and was gone three days.  It was</span><br/>
<span>dreadful lonesome.  I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever</span><br/>
<span>going to get out any more.  I was scared.  I made up my mind I would fix</span><br/>
<span>up some way to leave there.  I had tried to get out of that cabin many</span><br/>
<span>a time, but I couldn’t find no way.  There warn’t a window to it big</span><br/>
<span>enough for a dog to get through.  I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it</span><br/>
<span>was too narrow.  The door was thick, solid oak slabs.  Pap was pretty</span><br/>
<span>careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;</span><br/>
<span>I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I</span><br/>
<span>was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in</span><br/>
<span>the time.  But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty</span><br/>
<span>wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the</span><br/>
<span>clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.  There was an</span><br/>
<span>old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin</span><br/>
<span>behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and</span><br/>
<span>putting the candle out.  I got under the table and raised the blanket,</span><br/>
<span>and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough</span><br/>
<span>to let me through.  Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting</span><br/>
<span>towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.  I got rid of</span><br/>
<span>the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon pap come in.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pap warn’t in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  He said he was</span><br/>
<span>down town, and everything was going wrong.  His lawyer said he reckoned</span><br/>
<span>he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on</span><br/>
<span>the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge</span><br/>
<span>Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be</span><br/>
<span>another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my</span><br/>
<span>guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  This shook me up</span><br/>
<span>considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more</span><br/>
<span>and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.  Then the old man</span><br/>
<span>got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,</span><br/>
<span>and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,</span><br/>
<span>and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,</span><br/>
<span>including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the names</span><br/>
<span>of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and went</span><br/>
<span>right along with his cussing.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He said he would like to see the widow get me.  He said he would watch</span><br/>
<span>out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place</span><br/>
<span>six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they</span><br/>
<span>dropped and they couldn’t find me.  That made me pretty uneasy again,</span><br/>
<span>but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand till he got</span><br/>
<span>that chance.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had</span><br/>
<span>got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,</span><br/>
<span>ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two</span><br/>
<span>newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  I toted up a load, and went</span><br/>
<span>back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  I thought it all</span><br/>
<span>over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and</span><br/>
<span>take to the woods when I run away.  I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one</span><br/>
<span>place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and</span><br/>
<span>hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor</span><br/>
<span>the widow couldn’t ever find me any more.  I judged I would saw out and</span><br/>
<span>leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.  I</span><br/>
<span>got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the old</span><br/>
<span>man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  While</span><br/>
<span>I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of</span><br/>
<span>warmed up, and went to ripping again.  He had been drunk over in town,</span><br/>
<span>and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  A body</span><br/>
<span>would a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud.  Whenever his liquor</span><br/>
<span>begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s like.</span><br/>
<span>Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him--a</span><br/>
<span>man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety</span><br/>
<span>and all the expense of raising.  Yes, just as that man has got that</span><br/>
<span>son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for</span><br/>
<span>_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.  And they call</span><br/>
<span>_that_ govment!  That ain’t all, nuther.  The law backs that old Judge</span><br/>
<span>Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property.  Here’s what</span><br/>
<span>the law does:  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and</span><br/>
<span>up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets</span><br/>
<span>him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that</span><br/>
<span>govment!  A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes</span><br/>
<span>I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,</span><br/>
<span>and I _told_ ‘em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.  Lots of ‘em</span><br/>
<span>heard me, and can tell what I said.  Says I, for two cents I’d leave the</span><br/>
<span>blamed country and never come a-near it agin.  Them’s the very words.  I</span><br/>
<span>says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the</span><br/>
<span>rest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightly</span><br/>
<span>a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’</span><br/>
<span>stove-pipe.  Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the</span><br/>
<span>wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here.</span><br/>
<span>There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as</span><br/>
<span>a white man.  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the</span><br/>
<span>shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fine</span><br/>
<span>clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a</span><br/>
<span>silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And</span><br/>
<span>what do you think?  They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and could</span><br/>
<span>talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain’t the</span><br/>
<span>wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.  Well, that let me</span><br/>
<span>out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?  It was ‘lection day,</span><br/>
<span>and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get</span><br/>
<span>there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where</span><br/>
<span>they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I’ll never vote agin.</span><br/>
<span>Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may</span><br/>
<span>rot for all me--I’ll never vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the</span><br/>
<span>cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>shoved him out o’ the way.  I says to the people, why ain’t this nigger</span><br/>
<span>put up at auction and sold?--that’s what I want to know.  And what do you</span><br/>
<span>reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in</span><br/>
<span>the State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet.  There,</span><br/>
<span>now--that’s a specimen.  They call that a govment that can’t sell a free</span><br/>
<span>nigger till he’s been in the State six months.  Here’s a govment that</span><br/>
<span>calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a</span><br/>
<span>govment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months before</span><br/>
<span>it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free</span><br/>
<span>nigger, and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was</span><br/>
<span>taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and</span><br/>
<span>barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind</span><br/>
<span>of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give</span><br/>
<span>the tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He hopped around the</span><br/>
<span>cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding</span><br/>
<span>first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his</span><br/>
<span>left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his</span><br/>
<span>toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that</span><br/>
<span>fairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and</span><br/>
<span>rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over</span><br/>
<span>anything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.</span><br/>
<span>He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid</span><br/>
<span>over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there</span><br/>
<span>for two drunks and one delirium tremens.  That was always his word.  I</span><br/>
<span>judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal</span><br/>
<span>the key, or saw myself out, one or t’other.  He drank and drank, and</span><br/>
<span>tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t run my way.</span><br/>
<span>He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and</span><br/>
<span>thrashed around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so</span><br/>
<span>sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I</span><br/>
<span>knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an</span><br/>
<span>awful scream and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping</span><br/>
<span>around every which way and yelling about snakes.  He said they was</span><br/>
<span>crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say</span><br/>
<span>one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn’t see no snakes.  He started</span><br/>
<span>and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him</span><br/>
<span>off! he’s biting me on the neck!”  I never see a man look so wild in the</span><br/>
<span>eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he</span><br/>
<span>rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,</span><br/>
<span>and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and</span><br/>
<span>saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid</span><br/>
<span>still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.</span><br/>
<span>I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it</span><br/>
<span>seemed terrible still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he</span><br/>
<span>raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.  He says,</span><br/>
<span>very low:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tramp--tramp--tramp; that’s the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they’re coming</span><br/>
<span>after me; but I won’t go.  Oh, they’re here! don’t touch me--don’t! hands</span><br/>
<span>off--they’re cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him</span><br/>
<span>alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the</span><br/>
<span>old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could</span><br/>
<span>hear him through the blanket.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he</span><br/>
<span>see me and went for me.  He chased me round and round the place with a</span><br/>
<span>clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,</span><br/>
<span>and then I couldn’t come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I</span><br/>
<span>was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and</span><br/>
<span>cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and</span><br/>
<span>dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my</span><br/>
<span>shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick</span><br/>
<span>as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and</span><br/>
<span>dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a</span><br/>
<span>minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would</span><br/>
<span>sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he dozed off pretty soon.  By and by I got the old split-bottom chair</span><br/>
<span>and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the</span><br/>
<span>gun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I</span><br/>
<span>laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down</span><br/>
<span>behind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow and still the time did</span><br/>
<span>drag along.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter VII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“GIT up!  What you ‘bout?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.  It</span><br/>
<span>was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.  Pap was standing over me</span><br/>
<span>looking sour and sick, too.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What you doin’ with this gun?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why didn’t you roust me out?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, all right.  Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out with</span><br/>
<span>you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast.  I’ll be along</span><br/>
<span>in a minute.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.  I noticed</span><br/>
<span>some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of</span><br/>
<span>bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have</span><br/>
<span>great times now if I was over at the town.  The June rise used to be</span><br/>
<span>always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes</span><br/>
<span>cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs</span><br/>
<span>together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the</span><br/>
<span>wood-yards and the sawmill.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one out</span><br/>
<span>for what the rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a</span><br/>
<span>canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding</span><br/>
<span>high like a duck.  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,</span><br/>
<span>clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I just expected</span><br/>
<span>there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that</span><br/>
<span>to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’d</span><br/>
<span>raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn’t so this time.  It was a</span><br/>
<span>drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks</span><br/>
<span>I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she’s worth ten dollars.</span><br/>
<span>But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was running</span><br/>
<span>her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and</span><br/>
<span>willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I’d hide her good, and then,</span><br/>
<span>‘stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the river</span><br/>
<span>about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a</span><br/>
<span>rough time tramping on foot.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man</span><br/>
<span>coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around</span><br/>
<span>a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just</span><br/>
<span>drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.  So he hadn’t seen anything.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.  He abused</span><br/>
<span>me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and</span><br/>
<span>that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and</span><br/>
<span>then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines</span><br/>
<span>and went home.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about</span><br/>
<span>wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap</span><br/>
<span>and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing</span><br/>
<span>than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you</span><br/>
<span>see, all kinds of things might happen.  Well, I didn’t see no way for a</span><br/>
<span>while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of</span><br/>
<span>water, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you</span><br/>
<span>hear? That man warn’t here for no good.  I’d a shot him.  Next time you</span><br/>
<span>roust me out, you hear?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been</span><br/>
<span>saying give me the very idea I wanted.  I says to myself, I can fix it</span><br/>
<span>now so nobody won’t think of following me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The</span><br/>
<span>river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the</span><br/>
<span>rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.</span><br/>
<span>We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.</span><br/>
<span>Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch</span><br/>
<span>more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style.  Nine logs was enough for one</span><br/>
<span>time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and</span><br/>
<span>took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.</span><br/>
<span>I judged he wouldn’t come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he</span><br/>
<span>had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that</span><br/>
<span>log again.  Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of the</span><br/>
<span>hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and</span><br/>
<span>shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same</span><br/>
<span>with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and</span><br/>
<span>sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the</span><br/>
<span>bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two</span><br/>
<span>blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and</span><br/>
<span>matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned</span><br/>
<span>out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one out</span><br/>
<span>at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched</span><br/>
<span>out the gun, and now I was done.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging</span><br/>
<span>out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside</span><br/>
<span>by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the</span><br/>
<span>sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two</span><br/>
<span>rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up</span><br/>
<span>at that place and didn’t quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five</span><br/>
<span>foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice</span><br/>
<span>it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likely</span><br/>
<span>anybody would go fooling around there.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track.  I</span><br/>
<span>followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the</span><br/>
<span>river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,</span><br/>
<span>and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon</span><br/>
<span>went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie</span><br/>
<span>farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it</span><br/>
<span>considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly</span><br/>
<span>to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down</span><br/>
<span>on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,</span><br/>
<span>and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks</span><br/>
<span>in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to</span><br/>
<span>the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and</span><br/>
<span>down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been</span><br/>
<span>dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he</span><br/>
<span>would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy</span><br/>
<span>touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as</span><br/>
<span>that.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and</span><br/>
<span>stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I</span><br/>
<span>took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket <i>(so he couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>drip)</i> till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into</span><br/>
<span>the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag</span><br/>
<span>of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.</span><br/>
<span>I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the</span><br/>
<span>bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the</span><br/>
<span>place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then</span><br/>
<span>I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through</span><br/>
<span>the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide</span><br/>
<span>and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There</span><br/>
<span>was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went</span><br/>
<span>miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river.  The meal</span><br/>
<span>sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped</span><br/>
<span>pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by</span><br/>
<span>accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some</span><br/>
<span>willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I</span><br/>
<span>made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid</span><br/>
<span>down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,</span><br/>
<span>they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then</span><br/>
<span>drag the river for me.  And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake</span><br/>
<span>and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers</span><br/>
<span>that killed me and took the things.  They won’t ever hunt the river for</span><br/>
<span>anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’t</span><br/>
<span>bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.</span><br/>
<span>Jackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,</span><br/>
<span>and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,</span><br/>
<span>and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the</span><br/>
<span>place.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When</span><br/>
<span>I woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked</span><br/>
<span>around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and</span><br/>
<span>miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs</span><br/>
<span>that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from</span><br/>
<span>shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.</span><br/>
<span>You know what I mean--I don’t know the words to put it in.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start</span><br/>
<span>when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I</span><br/>
<span>made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from</span><br/>
<span>oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night.  I peeped out through</span><br/>
<span>the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.</span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was</span><br/>
<span>abreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it.  Think’s I, maybe</span><br/>
<span>it’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him.  He dropped below me with the</span><br/>
<span>current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,</span><br/>
<span>and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.</span><br/>
<span>Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his</span><br/>
<span>oars.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream</span><br/>
<span>soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,</span><br/>
<span>and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of</span><br/>
<span>the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and</span><br/>
<span>people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and</span><br/>
<span>then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking</span><br/>
<span>away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when</span><br/>
<span>you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.</span><br/>
<span>And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people</span><br/>
<span>talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word</span><br/>
<span>of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short</span><br/>
<span>nights now.  T’other one said _this_ warn’t one of the short ones, he</span><br/>
<span>reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they</span><br/>
<span>laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and</span><br/>
<span>laughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said</span><br/>
<span>let him alone.  The first fellow said he ‘lowed to tell it to his</span><br/>
<span>old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn’t</span><br/>
<span>nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it</span><br/>
<span>was nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than</span><br/>
<span>about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,</span><br/>
<span>and I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,</span><br/>
<span>and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson’s</span><br/>
<span>Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and</span><br/>
<span>standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like</span><br/>
<span>a steamboat without any lights.  There warn’t any signs of the bar at</span><br/>
<span>the head--it was all under water now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It didn’t take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping</span><br/>
<span>rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and</span><br/>
<span>landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into</span><br/>
<span>a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow</span><br/>
<span>branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe</span><br/>
<span>from the outside.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked</span><br/>
<span>out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,</span><br/>
<span>three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A</span><br/>
<span>monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,</span><br/>
<span>with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,</span><br/>
<span>and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern</span><br/>
<span>oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plain</span><br/>
<span>as if the man was by my side.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and</span><br/>
<span>laid down for a nap before breakfast.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter VIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight</span><br/>
<span>o’clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about</span><br/>
<span>things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I</span><br/>
<span>could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees</span><br/>
<span>all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places</span><br/>
<span>on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the</span><br/>
<span>freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little</span><br/>
<span>breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me</span><br/>
<span>very friendly.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn’t want to get up and cook</span><br/>
<span>breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep</span><br/>
<span>sound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow</span><br/>
<span>and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and</span><br/>
<span>looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying</span><br/>
<span>on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the</span><br/>
<span>ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the</span><br/>
<span>matter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat’s</span><br/>
<span>side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my</span><br/>
<span>carcass come to the top.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,</span><br/>
<span>because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the</span><br/>
<span>cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,</span><br/>
<span>and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good</span><br/>
<span>enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to</span><br/>
<span>eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in</span><br/>
<span>loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the</span><br/>
<span>drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and</span><br/>
<span>if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show.  I</span><br/>
<span>changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could</span><br/>
<span>have, and I warn’t disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I</span><br/>
<span>most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out</span><br/>
<span>further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the</span><br/>
<span>shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,</span><br/>
<span>and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab</span><br/>
<span>of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker’s bread”--what the</span><br/>
<span>quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching</span><br/>
<span>the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And</span><br/>
<span>then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson</span><br/>
<span>or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone</span><br/>
<span>and done it.  So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in that</span><br/>
<span>thing--that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow or the</span><br/>
<span>parson prays, but it don’t work for me, and I reckon it don’t work for</span><br/>
<span>only just the right kind.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The</span><br/>
<span>ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a chance</span><br/>
<span>to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in</span><br/>
<span>close, where the bread did.  When she’d got pretty well along down</span><br/>
<span>towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,</span><br/>
<span>and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where</span><br/>
<span>the log forked I could peep through.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could</span><br/>
<span>a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.</span><br/>
<span>Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom</span><br/>
<span>Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.</span><br/>
<span>Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s</span><br/>
<span>washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.  I</span><br/>
<span>hope so, anyway.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly</span><br/>
<span>in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see</span><br/>
<span>them first-rate, but they couldn’t see me.  Then the captain sung out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that</span><br/>
<span>it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and</span><br/>
<span>I judged I was gone.  If they’d a had some bullets in, I reckon they’d</span><br/>
<span>a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn’t hurt, thanks to</span><br/>
<span>goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder</span><br/>
<span>of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and</span><br/>
<span>further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn’t hear it no more.</span><br/>
<span>The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and</span><br/>
<span>was giving it up.  But they didn’t yet a while.  They turned around</span><br/>
<span>the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,</span><br/>
<span>under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over</span><br/>
<span>to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the</span><br/>
<span>island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and</span><br/>
<span>went home to the town.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after</span><br/>
<span>me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick</span><br/>
<span>woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things</span><br/>
<span>under so the rain couldn’t get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled</span><br/>
<span>him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had</span><br/>
<span>supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well</span><br/>
<span>satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set</span><br/>
<span>on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the</span><br/>
<span>stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;</span><br/>
<span>there ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you</span><br/>
<span>can’t stay so, you soon get over it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.</span><br/>
<span>But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was</span><br/>
<span>boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know</span><br/>
<span>all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty</span><br/>
<span>strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green</span><br/>
<span>razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They</span><br/>
<span>would all come handy by and by, I judged.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t</span><br/>
<span>far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shot</span><br/>
<span>nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh</span><br/>
<span>home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,</span><br/>
<span>and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after</span><br/>
<span>it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I</span><br/>
<span>bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look</span><br/>
<span>further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as</span><br/>
<span>fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the</span><br/>
<span>thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hear</span><br/>
<span>nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;</span><br/>
<span>and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod</span><br/>
<span>on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my</span><br/>
<span>breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sand</span><br/>
<span>in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around.  So I</span><br/>
<span>got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,</span><br/>
<span>and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an</span><br/>
<span>old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing,</span><br/>
<span>I didn’t hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a</span><br/>
<span>thousand things.  Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last I</span><br/>
<span>got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the</span><br/>
<span>time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from</span><br/>
<span>breakfast.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good</span><br/>
<span>and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the</span><br/>
<span>Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and</span><br/>
<span>cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there</span><br/>
<span>all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says</span><br/>
<span>to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices.  I got</span><br/>
<span>everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping</span><br/>
<span>through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn’t got far when I</span><br/>
<span>hear a man say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about</span><br/>
<span>beat out.  Let’s look around.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the</span><br/>
<span>old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t sleep much.  I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking.  And every time</span><br/>
<span>I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn’t</span><br/>
<span>do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’m</span><br/>
<span>a-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll</span><br/>
<span>find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and</span><br/>
<span>then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was</span><br/>
<span>shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.</span><br/>
<span>I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound</span><br/>
<span>asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A</span><br/>
<span>little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying</span><br/>
<span>the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung</span><br/>
<span>her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge</span><br/>
<span>of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the</span><br/>
<span>leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket</span><br/>
<span>the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,</span><br/>
<span>and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards</span><br/>
<span>where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two</span><br/>
<span>to listen.  But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the</span><br/>
<span>place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away</span><br/>
<span>through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was</span><br/>
<span>close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It</span><br/>
<span>most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his</span><br/>
<span>head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in</span><br/>
<span>about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting</span><br/>
<span>gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove</span><br/>
<span>off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim!  I bet I was glad to see</span><br/>
<span>him.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,</span><br/>
<span>and puts his hands together and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Doan’ hurt me--don’t!  I hain’t ever done no harm to a ghos’.  I alwuz</span><br/>
<span>liked dead people, en done all I could for ‘em.  You go en git in de</span><br/>
<span>river agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ‘at ‘uz</span><br/>
<span>awluz yo’ fren’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead.  I was ever so</span><br/>
<span>glad to see Jim.  I warn’t lonesome now.  I told him I warn’t afraid of</span><br/>
<span>_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set</span><br/>
<span>there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s good daylight.  Le’s get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich</span><br/>
<span>truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den</span><br/>
<span>strawbries.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.  “Is that what you live on?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What, all that time?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes--indeedy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah--nuffn else.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reck’n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de</span><br/>
<span>islan’?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Since the night I got killed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No!  W’y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got</span><br/>
<span>a gun.  Dat’s good.  Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in</span><br/>
<span>a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and</span><br/>
<span>coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the</span><br/>
<span>nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done</span><br/>
<span>with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him</span><br/>
<span>with his knife, and fried him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.</span><br/>
<span>Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then</span><br/>
<span>when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.  By and by</span><br/>
<span>Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ‘uz killed in dat shanty ef it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.  He said Tom</span><br/>
<span>Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had.  Then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute.  Then he</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Maybe I better not tell.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, dey’s reasons.  But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you,</span><br/>
<span>would you, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blamed if I would, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck.  I--_I run off_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jim!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell--you know you said you wouldn’ tell,</span><br/>
<span>Huck.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I did.  I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it.  Honest _injun_,</span><br/>
<span>I will.  People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for</span><br/>
<span>keeping mum--but that don’t make no difference.  I ain’t a-going to tell,</span><br/>
<span>and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways.  So, now, le’s know all about</span><br/>
<span>it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you see, it ‘uz dis way.  Ole missus--dat’s Miss Watson--she pecks</span><br/>
<span>on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans.  But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader</span><br/>
<span>roun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.  Well, one</span><br/>
<span>night I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en I</span><br/>
<span>hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but</span><br/>
<span>she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me, en it</span><br/>
<span>‘uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’.  De widder she try to</span><br/>
<span>git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear de res’.  I</span><br/>
<span>lit out mighty quick, I tell you.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ‘spec to steal a skift ‘long de</span><br/>
<span>sho’ som’ers ‘bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid</span><br/>
<span>in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to</span><br/>
<span>go ‘way. Well, I wuz dah all night.  Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time.</span><br/>
<span>‘Long ‘bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ‘bout eight er</span><br/>
<span>nine every skift dat went ‘long wuz talkin’ ‘bout how yo’ pap come over</span><br/>
<span>to de town en say you’s killed.  Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies en</span><br/>
<span>genlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place.  Sometimes dey’d pull up at</span><br/>
<span>de sho’ en take a res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to</span><br/>
<span>know all ‘bout de killin’.  I ‘uz powerful sorry you’s killed, Huck, but</span><br/>
<span>I ain’t no mo’ now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I laid dah under de shavin’s all day.  I ‘uz hungry, but I warn’t</span><br/>
<span>afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin’ to start to</span><br/>
<span>de camp-meet’n’ right arter breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows</span><br/>
<span>I goes off wid de cattle ‘bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ‘spec to see me</span><br/>
<span>roun’ de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’.</span><br/>
<span>De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en take holiday</span><br/>
<span>soon as de ole folks ‘uz out’n de way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ‘bout two</span><br/>
<span>mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses.  I’d made up my mine ‘bout</span><br/>
<span>what I’s agwyne to do.  You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot,</span><br/>
<span>de dogs ‘ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat</span><br/>
<span>skift, you see, en dey’d know ‘bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, en</span><br/>
<span>whah to pick up my track.  So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’</span><br/>
<span>_make_ no track.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’</span><br/>
<span>a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in</span><br/>
<span>‘mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin de</span><br/>
<span>current tell de raff come along.  Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck</span><br/>
<span>a-holt.  It clouded up en ‘uz pooty dark for a little while.  So I clumb</span><br/>
<span>up en laid down on de planks.  De men ‘uz all ‘way yonder in de middle,</span><br/>
<span>whah de lantern wuz.  De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good current;</span><br/>
<span>so I reck’n’d ‘at by fo’ in de mawnin’ I’d be twenty-five mile down de</span><br/>
<span>river, en den I’d slip in jis b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to</span><br/>
<span>de woods on de Illinois side.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I didn’ have no luck.  When we ‘uz mos’ down to de head er de</span><br/>
<span>islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn’t no use</span><br/>
<span>fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan’.  Well, I</span><br/>
<span>had a notion I could lan’ mos’ anywhers, but I couldn’t--bank too bluff.</span><br/>
<span>I ‘uz mos’ to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good place.  I went</span><br/>
<span>into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs no mo’, long as dey</span><br/>
<span>move de lantern roun’ so.  I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some</span><br/>
<span>matches in my cap, en dey warn’t wet, so I ‘uz all right.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?  Why</span><br/>
<span>didn’t you get mud-turkles?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How you gwyne to git ‘m?  You can’t slip up on um en grab um; en how’s</span><br/>
<span>a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock?  How could a body do it in de night?</span><br/>
<span>En I warn’t gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that’s so.  You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of</span><br/>
<span>course. Did you hear ‘em shooting the cannon?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes.  I knowed dey was arter you.  I see um go by heah--watched um</span><br/>
<span>thoo de bushes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and</span><br/>
<span>lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.  He said it was</span><br/>
<span>a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the</span><br/>
<span>same way when young birds done it.  I was going to catch some of them,</span><br/>
<span>but Jim wouldn’t let me.  He said it was death.  He said his father laid</span><br/>
<span>mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny</span><br/>
<span>said his father would die, and he did.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for</span><br/>
<span>dinner, because that would bring bad luck.  The same if you shook the</span><br/>
<span>table-cloth after sundown.  And he said if a man owned a beehive</span><br/>
<span>and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next</span><br/>
<span>morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.</span><br/>
<span>Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, because</span><br/>
<span>I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.  Jim</span><br/>
<span>knowed all kinds of signs.  He said he knowed most everything.  I said</span><br/>
<span>it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked</span><br/>
<span>him if there warn’t any good-luck signs.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mighty few--an’ _dey_ ain’t no use to a body.  What you want to know</span><br/>
<span>when good luck’s a-comin’ for?  Want to keep it off?”  And he said:  “Ef</span><br/>
<span>you’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne</span><br/>
<span>to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ‘kase it’s so fur</span><br/>
<span>ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so you</span><br/>
<span>might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ‘f you didn’ know by de sign dat</span><br/>
<span>you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s de use to ax dat question?  Don’t you see I has?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, are you rich?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.  Wunst I had</span><br/>
<span>foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you speculate in, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, fust I tackled stock.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What kind of stock?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, live stock--cattle, you know.  I put ten dollars in a cow.  But</span><br/>
<span>I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock.  De cow up ‘n’ died on my</span><br/>
<span>han’s.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So you lost the ten dollars.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, I didn’t lose it all.  I on’y los’ ‘bout nine of it.  I sole de</span><br/>
<span>hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You had five dollars and ten cents left.  Did you speculate any more?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.  You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old Misto</span><br/>
<span>Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar</span><br/>
<span>would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year.  Well, all de niggers</span><br/>
<span>went in, but dey didn’t have much.  I wuz de on’y one dat had much.  So</span><br/>
<span>I stuck out for mo’ dan fo’ dollars, en I said ‘f I didn’ git it I’d</span><br/>
<span>start a bank mysef. Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out er</span><br/>
<span>de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ‘nough for two banks, so</span><br/>
<span>he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en’</span><br/>
<span>er de year.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So I done it.  Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ de thirty-five dollars right</span><br/>
<span>off en keep things a-movin’.  Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat had</span><br/>
<span>ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn’ know it; en I bought it off’n</span><br/>
<span>him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de</span><br/>
<span>year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de</span><br/>
<span>one-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted.  So dey didn’ none uv us git no</span><br/>
<span>money.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I ‘uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me</span><br/>
<span>to give it to a nigger name’ Balum--Balum’s Ass dey call him for short;</span><br/>
<span>he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.  But he’s lucky, dey say, en I</span><br/>
<span>see I warn’t lucky.  De dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d</span><br/>
<span>make a raise for me.  Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in</span><br/>
<span>church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de</span><br/>
<span>Lord, en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times.  So Balum he tuck</span><br/>
<span>en give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to</span><br/>
<span>come of it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nuffn never come of it.  I couldn’ manage to k’leck dat money no way;</span><br/>
<span>en Balum he couldn’.  I ain’ gwyne to len’ no mo’ money ‘dout I see de</span><br/>
<span>security.  Boun’ to git yo’ money back a hund’d times, de preacher says!</span><br/>
<span>Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er de</span><br/>
<span>chanst.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re going to be rich again</span><br/>
<span>some time or other.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it.  I owns mysef, en I’s wuth</span><br/>
<span>eight hund’d dollars.  I wisht I had de money, I wouldn’ want no mo’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter IX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island</span><br/>
<span>that I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,</span><br/>
<span>because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile</span><br/>
<span>wide.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot</span><br/>
<span>high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and</span><br/>
<span>the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by</span><br/>
<span>and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the</span><br/>
<span>side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms</span><br/>
<span>bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in</span><br/>
<span>there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we</span><br/>
<span>didn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps</span><br/>
<span>in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,</span><br/>
<span>and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them</span><br/>
<span>little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to</span><br/>
<span>get wet?</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,</span><br/>
<span>and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by</span><br/>
<span>to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off</span><br/>
<span>of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one</span><br/>
<span>side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a</span><br/>
<span>good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.</span><br/>
<span>We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was</span><br/>
<span>right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,</span><br/>
<span>too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular</span><br/>
<span>summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black</span><br/>
<span>outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that</span><br/>
<span>the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would</span><br/>
<span>come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the</span><br/>
<span>pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would</span><br/>
<span>follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they</span><br/>
<span>was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and</span><br/>
<span>blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little</span><br/>
<span>glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,</span><br/>
<span>hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again</span><br/>
<span>in a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,</span><br/>
<span>and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the</span><br/>
<span>under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where</span><br/>
<span>it’s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jim, this is nice,” I says.  “I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but</span><br/>
<span>here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ‘f it hadn’t a ben for Jim.  You’d a ben</span><br/>
<span>down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too;</span><br/>
<span>dat you would, honey.  Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do</span><br/>
<span>de birds, chile.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at</span><br/>
<span>last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on</span><br/>
<span>the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side</span><br/>
<span>it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same</span><br/>
<span>old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a</span><br/>
<span>wall of high bluffs.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool</span><br/>
<span>and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We</span><br/>
<span>went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung</span><br/>
<span>so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old</span><br/>
<span>broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and</span><br/>
<span>when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on</span><br/>
<span>account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your</span><br/>
<span>hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would</span><br/>
<span>slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.</span><br/>
<span>We could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.</span><br/>
<span>It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and</span><br/>
<span>the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.  We</span><br/>
<span>could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;</span><br/>
<span>we didn’t show ourselves in daylight.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before</span><br/>
<span>daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was</span><br/>
<span>a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got</span><br/>
<span>aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,</span><br/>
<span>so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then</span><br/>
<span>we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and</span><br/>
<span>two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there</span><br/>
<span>was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the</span><br/>
<span>floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello, you!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But it didn’t budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“De man ain’t asleep--he’s dead.  You hold still--I’ll go en see.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He went, and bent down and looked, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a dead man.  Yes, indeedy; naked, too.  He’s ben shot in de back.</span><br/>
<span>I reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days.  Come in, Huck, but doan’ look</span><br/>
<span>at his face--it’s too gashly.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but</span><br/>
<span>he needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him.  There was heaps of old</span><br/>
<span>greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,</span><br/>
<span>and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls</span><br/>
<span>was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.</span><br/>
<span>There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some</span><br/>
<span>women’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing,</span><br/>
<span>too.  We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.  There was a</span><br/>
<span>boy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there</span><br/>
<span>was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a</span><br/>
<span>baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was</span><br/>
<span>a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They</span><br/>
<span>stood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account.</span><br/>
<span>The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a</span><br/>
<span>hurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and</span><br/>
<span>a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow</span><br/>
<span>candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty</span><br/>
<span>old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and</span><br/>
<span>beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet</span><br/>
<span>and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some</span><br/>
<span>monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,</span><br/>
<span>and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label</span><br/>
<span>on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,</span><br/>
<span>and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps</span><br/>
<span>was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though</span><br/>
<span>it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t find</span><br/>
<span>the other one, though we hunted all around.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to</span><br/>
<span>shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty</span><br/>
<span>broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the</span><br/>
<span>quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good</span><br/>
<span>ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most</span><br/>
<span>a half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and</span><br/>
<span>hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody.  We got home all safe.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter X.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he</span><br/>
<span>come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to.  He said it would fetch bad</span><br/>
<span>luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he said a man</span><br/>
<span>that warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting around than one</span><br/>
<span>that was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty reasonable, so</span><br/>
<span>I didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t keep from studying over it and</span><br/>
<span>wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver</span><br/>
<span>sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.  Jim said he reckoned</span><br/>
<span>the people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d a knowed the</span><br/>
<span>money was there they wouldn’t a left it.  I said I reckoned they killed</span><br/>
<span>him, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about that.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the</span><br/>
<span>snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?</span><br/>
<span>You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin</span><br/>
<span>with my hands.  Well, here’s your bad luck!  We’ve raked in all this</span><br/>
<span>truck and eight dollars besides.  I wish we could have some bad luck</span><br/>
<span>like this every day, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Never you mind, honey, never you mind.  Don’t you git too peart.  It’s</span><br/>
<span>a-comin’.  Mind I tell you, it’s a-comin’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It did come, too.  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.  Well, after</span><br/>
<span>dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the</span><br/>
<span>ridge, and got out of tobacco.  I went to the cavern to get some, and</span><br/>
<span>found a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him, and curled him up on the</span><br/>
<span>foot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d be some fun</span><br/>
<span>when Jim found him there.  Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,</span><br/>
<span>and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light</span><br/>
<span>the snake’s mate was there, and bit him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the</span><br/>
<span>varmint curled up and ready for another spring.  I laid him out in a</span><br/>
<span>second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour</span><br/>
<span>it down.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  That all</span><br/>
<span>comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave</span><br/>
<span>a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told</span><br/>
<span>me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the</span><br/>
<span>body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it</span><br/>
<span>would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around</span><br/>
<span>his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet</span><br/>
<span>and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going</span><br/>
<span>to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his</span><br/>
<span>head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he</span><br/>
<span>went to sucking at the jug again.  His foot swelled up pretty big, and</span><br/>
<span>so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged</span><br/>
<span>he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s</span><br/>
<span>whisky.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all</span><br/>
<span>gone and he was around again.  I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take</span><br/>
<span>a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come</span><br/>
<span>of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said</span><br/>
<span>that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his</span><br/>
<span>left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin</span><br/>
<span>in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve</span><br/>
<span>always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is</span><br/>
<span>one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank</span><br/>
<span>Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he</span><br/>
<span>got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so</span><br/>
<span>that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him</span><br/>
<span>edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so</span><br/>
<span>they say, but I didn’t see it.  Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of</span><br/>
<span>looking at the moon that way, like a fool.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks</span><br/>
<span>again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big</span><br/>
<span>hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was</span><br/>
<span>as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two</span><br/>
<span>hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us</span><br/>
<span>into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around</span><br/>
<span>till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round</span><br/>
<span>ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,</span><br/>
<span>and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to</span><br/>
<span>coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever</span><br/>
<span>catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn’t ever seen</span><br/>
<span>a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.</span><br/>
<span>They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house</span><br/>
<span>there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes</span><br/>
<span>a good fry.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a</span><br/>
<span>stirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and</span><br/>
<span>find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I</span><br/>
<span>must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?</span><br/>
<span>That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico</span><br/>
<span>gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim</span><br/>
<span>hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the</span><br/>
<span>sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in</span><br/>
<span>and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said</span><br/>
<span>nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around</span><br/>
<span>all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty</span><br/>
<span>well in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said</span><br/>
<span>I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took</span><br/>
<span>notice, and done better.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and</span><br/>
<span>the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I</span><br/>
<span>tied up and started along the bank.  There was a light burning in a</span><br/>
<span>little shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered</span><br/>
<span>who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the</span><br/>
<span>window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by</span><br/>
<span>a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn’t know her face; she was a</span><br/>
<span>stranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’t know.</span><br/>
<span>Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had</span><br/>
<span>come; people might know my voice and find me out.  But if this woman had</span><br/>
<span>been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to</span><br/>
<span>know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I</span><br/>
<span>was a girl.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“COME in,” says the woman, and I did.  She says:  “Take a cheer.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What might your name be?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Sarah Williams.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Where ‘bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?’</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No’m.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I’ve walked all the way and</span><br/>
<span>I’m all tired out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hungry, too, I reckon.  I’ll find you something.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No’m, I ain’t hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below</span><br/>
<span>here at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more.  It’s what makes me so late.</span><br/>
<span>My mother’s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to</span><br/>
<span>tell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at the upper end of the town, she</span><br/>
<span>says.  I hain’t ever been here before.  Do you know him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No; but I don’t know everybody yet.  I haven’t lived here quite two</span><br/>
<span>weeks. It’s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.  You</span><br/>
<span>better stay here all night.  Take off your bonnet.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I ain’t afeared</span><br/>
<span>of the dark.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in</span><br/>
<span>by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along with me.</span><br/>
<span>Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up</span><br/>
<span>the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better</span><br/>
<span>off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made a mistake</span><br/>
<span>coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,</span><br/>
<span>till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what</span><br/>
<span>was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the</span><br/>
<span>murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.</span><br/>
<span>She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars <i>(only</span><br/>
<span>she got it ten)</i> and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what</span><br/>
<span>a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.  I</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who done it?  We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in</span><br/>
<span>Hookerville, but we don’t know who ‘twas that killed Huck Finn.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people _here_ that’d</span><br/>
<span>like to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it himself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No--is that so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Most everybody thought it at first.  He’ll never know how nigh he come</span><br/>
<span>to getting lynched.  But before night they changed around and judged it</span><br/>
<span>was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why _he_--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and never</span><br/>
<span>noticed I had put in at all:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So there’s a</span><br/>
<span>reward out for him--three hundred dollars.  And there’s a reward out for</span><br/>
<span>old Finn, too--two hundred dollars.  You see, he come to town the</span><br/>
<span>morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ‘em on the</span><br/>
<span>ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before night they</span><br/>
<span>wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they</span><br/>
<span>found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence</span><br/>
<span>ten o’clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on him,</span><br/>
<span>you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,</span><br/>
<span>and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the</span><br/>
<span>nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening</span><br/>
<span>he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty</span><br/>
<span>hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain’t</span><br/>
<span>come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing</span><br/>
<span>blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and</span><br/>
<span>fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get</span><br/>
<span>Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.</span><br/>
<span>People do say he warn’t any too good to do it.  Oh, he’s sly, I reckon.</span><br/>
<span>If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right.  You can’t prove</span><br/>
<span>anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and</span><br/>
<span>he’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, I reckon so, ‘m.  I don’t see nothing in the way of it.  Has</span><br/>
<span>everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But they’ll get</span><br/>
<span>the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, are they after him yet?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you!  Does three hundred dollars lay</span><br/>
<span>around every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the nigger</span><br/>
<span>ain’t far from here.  I’m one of them--but I hain’t talked it around.  A</span><br/>
<span>few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in</span><br/>
<span>the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to</span><br/>
<span>that island over yonder that they call Jackson’s Island.  Don’t anybody</span><br/>
<span>live there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn’t say any more, but</span><br/>
<span>I done some thinking.  I was pretty near certain I’d seen smoke over</span><br/>
<span>there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says</span><br/>
<span>to myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there; anyway, says</span><br/>
<span>I, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain’t seen any</span><br/>
<span>smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s gone, if it was him; but husband’s</span><br/>
<span>going over to see--him and another man.  He was gone up the river; but he</span><br/>
<span>got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still.  I had to do something with my</span><br/>
<span>hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading</span><br/>
<span>it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.  When the woman</span><br/>
<span>stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious</span><br/>
<span>and smiling a little.  I put down the needle and thread, and let on to</span><br/>
<span>be interested--and I was, too--and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother could get</span><br/>
<span>it. Is your husband going over there to-night?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a</span><br/>
<span>boat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They’ll go over after</span><br/>
<span>midnight.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.  And couldn’t the nigger see better, too?  After midnight he’ll</span><br/>
<span>likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up</span><br/>
<span>his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s got one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I didn’t think of that.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bit</span><br/>
<span>comfortable.  Pretty soon she says,</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you say your name was, honey?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“M--Mary Williams.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Somehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,</span><br/>
<span>and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would</span><br/>
<span>say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But</span><br/>
<span>now she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes’m, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah’s my first name.  Some</span><br/>
<span>calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, that’s the way of it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes’m.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.  I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t look up yet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor</span><br/>
<span>they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the</span><br/>
<span>place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right</span><br/>
<span>about the rats. You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner</span><br/>
<span>every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at</span><br/>
<span>them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace.  She showed</span><br/>
<span>me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot</span><br/>
<span>with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn’t</span><br/>
<span>know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,</span><br/>
<span>and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said</span><br/>
<span>“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.</span><br/>
<span>I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course</span><br/>
<span>I didn’t let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his</span><br/>
<span>nose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a</span><br/>
<span>tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I</span><br/>
<span>would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched</span><br/>
<span>it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help</span><br/>
<span>her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and</span><br/>
<span>went on talking about her and her husband’s matters.  But she broke off</span><br/>
<span>to say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,</span><br/>
<span>handy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped</span><br/>
<span>my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a</span><br/>
<span>minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,</span><br/>
<span>and very pleasant, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Come, now, what’s your real name?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Wh--what, mum?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do.  But</span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I’m in the</span><br/>
<span>way here, I’ll--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, you won’t.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain’t going to hurt</span><br/>
<span>you, and I ain’t going to tell on you, nuther.  You just tell me your</span><br/>
<span>secret, and trust me.  I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help</span><br/>
<span>you. So’ll my old man if you want him to.  You see, you’re a runaway</span><br/>
<span>‘prentice, that’s all.  It ain’t anything.  There ain’t no harm in it.</span><br/>
<span>You’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you,</span><br/>
<span>child, I wouldn’t tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that’s a good</span><br/>
<span>boy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I</span><br/>
<span>would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t</span><br/>
<span>go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,</span><br/>
<span>and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty</span><br/>
<span>mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand it</span><br/>
<span>no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my</span><br/>
<span>chance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and cleared out, and</span><br/>
<span>I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,</span><br/>
<span>and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from</span><br/>
<span>home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my</span><br/>
<span>uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck</span><br/>
<span>out for this town of Goshen.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Goshen, child?  This ain’t Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen’s</span><br/>
<span>ten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was Goshen?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn</span><br/>
<span>into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I</span><br/>
<span>must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter now.  I got</span><br/>
<span>to be moving along.  I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on a minute.  I’ll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she put me up a snack, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up first?  Answer</span><br/>
<span>up prompt now--don’t stop to study over it.  Which end gets up first?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The hind end, mum.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, a horse?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The for’rard end, mum.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“North side.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with</span><br/>
<span>their heads pointed the same direction?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The whole fifteen, mum.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.  I thought maybe you</span><br/>
<span>was trying to hocus me again.  What’s your real name, now?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“George Peters, mum.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, try to remember it, George.  Don’t forget and tell me it’s</span><br/>
<span>Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s George</span><br/>
<span>Elexander when I catch you.  And don’t go about women in that old</span><br/>
<span>calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.</span><br/>
<span>Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold the</span><br/>
<span>thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and</span><br/>
<span>poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but a</span><br/>
<span>man always does t’other way.  And when you throw at a rat or anything,</span><br/>
<span>hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as</span><br/>
<span>awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw</span><br/>
<span>stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to</span><br/>
<span>turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out</span><br/>
<span>to one side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch</span><br/>
<span>anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap them</span><br/>
<span>together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.  Why, I</span><br/>
<span>spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived</span><br/>
<span>the other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,</span><br/>
<span>Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble</span><br/>
<span>you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll do what I can</span><br/>
<span>to get you out of it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time</span><br/>
<span>you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s a rocky one,</span><br/>
<span>and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks</span><br/>
<span>and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I</span><br/>
<span>jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to</span><br/>
<span>make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the</span><br/>
<span>sun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then.  When I was about the</span><br/>
<span>middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the</span><br/>
<span>sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.  When I struck the</span><br/>
<span>head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but</span><br/>
<span>I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started</span><br/>
<span>a good fire there on a high and dry spot.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half</span><br/>
<span>below, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped through the timber</span><br/>
<span>and up the ridge and into the cavern.  There Jim laid, sound asleep on</span><br/>
<span>the ground.  I roused him out and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain’t a minute to lose.  They’re</span><br/>
<span>after us!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he</span><br/>
<span>worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.  By</span><br/>
<span>that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was</span><br/>
<span>ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We</span><br/>
<span>put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a</span><br/>
<span>candle outside after that.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;</span><br/>
<span>but if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows</span><br/>
<span>ain’t good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down</span><br/>
<span>in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a</span><br/>
<span>word.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>IT must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island at</span><br/>
<span>last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come</span><br/>
<span>along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois</span><br/>
<span>shore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever thought to</span><br/>
<span>put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We</span><br/>
<span>was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn’t</span><br/>
<span>good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I</span><br/>
<span>built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.  Anyways, they stayed</span><br/>
<span>away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a</span><br/>
<span>big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with</span><br/>
<span>the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there</span><br/>
<span>had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has</span><br/>
<span>cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois</span><br/>
<span>side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we</span><br/>
<span>warn’t afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,</span><br/>
<span>and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and</span><br/>
<span>up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all</span><br/>
<span>about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was</span><br/>
<span>a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t set</span><br/>
<span>down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she’d fetch a dog.  Well, then, I</span><br/>
<span>said, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he</span><br/>
<span>bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he</span><br/>
<span>believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that</span><br/>
<span>time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile</span><br/>
<span>below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.</span><br/>
<span>So I said I didn’t care what was the reason they didn’t get us as long</span><br/>
<span>as they didn’t.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the</span><br/>
<span>cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;</span><br/>
<span>so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug</span><br/>
<span>wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things</span><br/>
<span>dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above</span><br/>
<span>the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of</span><br/>
<span>reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a</span><br/>
<span>layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for</span><br/>
<span>to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather</span><br/>
<span>or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra</span><br/>
<span>steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag</span><br/>
<span>or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern</span><br/>
<span>on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat</span><br/>
<span>coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have</span><br/>
<span>to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call</span><br/>
<span>a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being</span><br/>
<span>still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the</span><br/>
<span>channel, but hunted easy water.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current</span><br/>
<span>that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,</span><br/>
<span>and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of</span><br/>
<span>solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking</span><br/>
<span>up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We</span><br/>
<span>had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to</span><br/>
<span>us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,</span><br/>
<span>nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The</span><br/>
<span>fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.</span><br/>
<span>In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand</span><br/>
<span>people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful</span><br/>
<span>spread of lights at two o’clock that still night.  There warn’t a sound</span><br/>
<span>there; everybody was asleep.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little</span><br/>
<span>village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other</span><br/>
<span>stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t roosting</span><br/>
<span>comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when</span><br/>
<span>you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy</span><br/>
<span>find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot.  I never see</span><br/>
<span>pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to</span><br/>
<span>say, anyway.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a</span><br/>
<span>watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of</span><br/>
<span>that kind.  Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things if you</span><br/>
<span>was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t</span><br/>
<span>anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.</span><br/>
<span>Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly</span><br/>
<span>right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things</span><br/>
<span>from the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more--then he reckoned</span><br/>
<span>it wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all</span><br/>
<span>one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds</span><br/>
<span>whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,</span><br/>
<span>or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and</span><br/>
<span>concluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons.  We warn’t feeling just</span><br/>
<span>right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way</span><br/>
<span>it come out, too, because crabapples ain’t ever good, and the p’simmons</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning</span><br/>
<span>or didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we</span><br/>
<span>lived pretty high.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with</span><br/>
<span>a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid</span><br/>
<span>sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.</span><br/>
<span>When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,</span><br/>
<span>and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,</span><br/>
<span>looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.</span><br/>
<span>We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very</span><br/>
<span>distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above</span><br/>
<span>water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a</span><br/>
<span>chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,</span><br/>
<span>when the flashes come.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,</span><br/>
<span>I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck</span><br/>
<span>laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I</span><br/>
<span>wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what</span><br/>
<span>there was there.  So I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Le’s land on her, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I doan’ want to go fool’n ‘long er no wrack.  We’s doin’ blame’ well,</span><br/>
<span>en we better let blame’ well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not</span><br/>
<span>dey’s a watchman on dat wrack.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t nothing to watch but</span><br/>
<span>the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody’s going to resk</span><br/>
<span>his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when</span><br/>
<span>it’s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jim</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t say nothing to that, so he didn’t try.  “And besides,” I says,</span><br/>
<span>“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom.</span><br/>
<span>Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat</span><br/>
<span>captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don’t</span><br/>
<span>care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a</span><br/>
<span>candle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.</span><br/>
<span>Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t. He’d call it an adventure--that’s what he’d call it; and he’d</span><br/>
<span>land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn’t he throw style</span><br/>
<span>into it?--wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you’d think it</span><br/>
<span>was Christopher C’lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer</span><br/>
<span>_was_ here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn’t talk any more</span><br/>
<span>than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us</span><br/>
<span>the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and</span><br/>
<span>made fast there.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to</span><br/>
<span>labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our</span><br/>
<span>feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so</span><br/>
<span>dark we couldn’t see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward</span><br/>
<span>end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in</span><br/>
<span>front of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down</span><br/>
<span>through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we</span><br/>
<span>seem to hear low voices in yonder!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come</span><br/>
<span>along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just</span><br/>
<span>then I heard a voice wail out and say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Another voice said, pretty loud:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a lie, Jim Turner.  You’ve acted this way before.  You always want</span><br/>
<span>more’n your share of the truck, and you’ve always got it, too, because</span><br/>
<span>you’ve swore ‘t if you didn’t you’d tell.  But this time you’ve said</span><br/>
<span>it jest one time too many.  You’re the meanest, treacherousest hound in</span><br/>
<span>this country.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with</span><br/>
<span>curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now,</span><br/>
<span>and so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here.  So I</span><br/>
<span>dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft</span><br/>
<span>in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and the</span><br/>
<span>cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the</span><br/>
<span>floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one</span><br/>
<span>of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.</span><br/>
<span>This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, and</span><br/>
<span>saying:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’d _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill;</span><br/>
<span>I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and</span><br/>
<span>say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Deed you _ain’t!_  You never said no truer thing ‘n that, you bet</span><br/>
<span>you.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the</span><br/>
<span>best of him and tied him he’d a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist</span><br/>
<span>for noth’n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that’s what for.  But</span><br/>
<span>I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put</span><br/>
<span>_up_ that pistol, Bill.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Bill says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t want to, Jake Packard.  I’m for killin’ him--and didn’t he kill</span><br/>
<span>old Hatfield jist the same way--and don’t he deserve it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I don’t _want_ him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I’ll never forgit you</span><br/>
<span>long’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Packard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail</span><br/>
<span>and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill</span><br/>
<span>to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat</span><br/>
<span>slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from getting</span><br/>
<span>run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.</span><br/>
<span>The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my</span><br/>
<span>stateroom, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here--come in here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up</span><br/>
<span>in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,</span><br/>
<span>with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn’t see</span><br/>
<span>them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having.</span><br/>
<span>I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much difference</span><br/>
<span>anyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn’t_</span><br/>
<span>breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted</span><br/>
<span>to kill Turner.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares</span><br/>
<span>to him _now_ it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way</span><br/>
<span>we’ve served him.  Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now</span><br/>
<span>you hear _me_.  I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t.  Well, then, that’s all</span><br/>
<span>right.  Le’s go and do it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit.  You listen to me.</span><br/>
<span>Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s _got_ to be</span><br/>
<span>done. But what I say is this:  it ain’t good sense to go court’n around</span><br/>
<span>after a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some way that’s</span><br/>
<span>jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks.  Ain’t</span><br/>
<span>that so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You bet it is.  But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, my idea is this:  we’ll rustle around and gather up whatever</span><br/>
<span>pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide</span><br/>
<span>the truck. Then we’ll wait.  Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two</span><br/>
<span>hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?</span><br/>
<span>He’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own</span><br/>
<span>self.  I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ‘n killin’ of him.</span><br/>
<span>I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’ it; it</span><br/>
<span>ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals.  Ain’t I right?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, I reck’n you are.  But s’pose she _don’t_ break up and wash off?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can’t we?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, then; come along.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled</span><br/>
<span>forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse</span><br/>
<span>whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a</span><br/>
<span>moan, and I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning; there’s a</span><br/>
<span>gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up their boat and set</span><br/>
<span>her drifting down the river so these fellows can’t get away from the</span><br/>
<span>wreck there’s one of ‘em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their</span><br/>
<span>boat we can put _all_ of ‘em in a bad fix--for the sheriff ‘ll get ‘em.</span><br/>
<span>Quick--hurry!  I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You</span><br/>
<span>start at the raft, and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf’_?  Dey ain’ no raf’ no mo’; she done broke</span><br/>
<span>loose en gone I--en here we is!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with</span><br/>
<span>such a gang as that!  But it warn’t no time to be sentimentering.  We’d</span><br/>
<span>_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went</span><br/>
<span>a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,</span><br/>
<span>too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim</span><br/>
<span>said he didn’t believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left</span><br/>
<span>on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck</span><br/>
<span>for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along</span><br/>
<span>forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the</span><br/>
<span>edge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the</span><br/>
<span>cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely</span><br/>
<span>see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been</span><br/>
<span>aboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his</span><br/>
<span>head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;</span><br/>
<span>but he jerked it in again, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and</span><br/>
<span>set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard</span><br/>
<span>says, in a low voice:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All ready--shove off!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on--‘d you go through him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No.  Didn’t you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No.  So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Maybe he won’t.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they got out and went in.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half</span><br/>
<span>second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my</span><br/>
<span>knife and cut the rope, and away we went!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even</span><br/>
<span>breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the</span><br/>
<span>paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a</span><br/>
<span>hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every</span><br/>
<span>last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern</span><br/>
<span>show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed</span><br/>
<span>by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to</span><br/>
<span>understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the</span><br/>
<span>first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for</span><br/>
<span>murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain’t no</span><br/>
<span>telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would</span><br/>
<span>I like it?  So says I to Jim:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or above</span><br/>
<span>it, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and</span><br/>
<span>then I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for</span><br/>
<span>that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when</span><br/>
<span>their time comes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,</span><br/>
<span>and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light</span><br/>
<span>showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,</span><br/>
<span>watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the</span><br/>
<span>rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,</span><br/>
<span>and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we</span><br/>
<span>made for it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We</span><br/>
<span>seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would</span><br/>
<span>go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole</span><br/>
<span>there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told</span><br/>
<span>Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone</span><br/>
<span>about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars</span><br/>
<span>and shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more</span><br/>
<span>showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore</span><br/>
<span>light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a</span><br/>
<span>lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed</span><br/>
<span>around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and</span><br/>
<span>by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between</span><br/>
<span>his knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to</span><br/>
<span>cry.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only</span><br/>
<span>me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello, what’s up?  Don’t cry, bub.  What’s the trouble?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Pap, and mam, and sis, and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I broke down.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, dang it now, _don’t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,</span><br/>
<span>and this ‘n ‘ll come out all right.  What’s the matter with ‘em?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They’re--they’re--are you the watchman of the boat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  “I’m the captain</span><br/>
<span>and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head</span><br/>
<span>deck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers.  I ain’t as</span><br/>
<span>rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous and good</span><br/>
<span>to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he</span><br/>
<span>does; but I’ve told him a many a time ‘t I wouldn’t trade places with</span><br/>
<span>him; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life for me, and I’m derned if</span><br/>
<span>_I’d_ live two mile out o’ town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’</span><br/>
<span>on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I broke in and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They’re in an awful peck of trouble, and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Who_ is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you’d take your</span><br/>
<span>ferryboat and go up there--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Up where?  Where are they?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“On the wreck.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What wreck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, there ain’t but one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What, you don’t mean the Walter Scott?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good land! what are they doin’ _there_, for gracious sakes?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, they didn’t go there a-purpose.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I bet they didn’t!  Why, great goodness, there ain’t no chance for ‘em</span><br/>
<span>if they don’t git off mighty quick!  Why, how in the nation did they</span><br/>
<span>ever git into such a scrape?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, Booth’s Landing--go on.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the edge of</span><br/>
<span>the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry</span><br/>
<span>to stay all night at her friend’s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I</span><br/>
<span>disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung</span><br/>
<span>around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and</span><br/>
<span>saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and</span><br/>
<span>the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard</span><br/>
<span>the wreck.  Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our</span><br/>
<span>trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t notice the wreck till we was</span><br/>
<span>right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but</span><br/>
<span>Bill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish ‘t it had</span><br/>
<span>been me, I do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My George!  It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And _then_ what</span><br/>
<span>did you all do?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>make nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help</span><br/>
<span>somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,</span><br/>
<span>and Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help sooner, come here and</span><br/>
<span>hunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing.  I made the land about a mile</span><br/>
<span>below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do</span><br/>
<span>something, but they said, ‘What, in such a night and such a current?</span><br/>
<span>There ain’t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.’  Now if you’ll go</span><br/>
<span>and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“By Jackson, I’d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don’t know but I will; but</span><br/>
<span>who in the dingnation’s a-going’ to _pay_ for it?  Do you reckon your</span><br/>
<span>pap--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why _that’s_ all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that</span><br/>
<span>her uncle Hornback--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Great guns! is _he_ her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that light</span><br/>
<span>over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a</span><br/>
<span>quarter of a mile out you’ll come to the tavern; tell ‘em to dart you</span><br/>
<span>out to Jim Hornback’s, and he’ll foot the bill.  And don’t you fool</span><br/>
<span>around any, because he’ll want to know the news.  Tell him I’ll have</span><br/>
<span>his niece all safe before he can get to town.  Hump yourself, now; I’m</span><br/>
<span>a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back</span><br/>
<span>and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in</span><br/>
<span>the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among</span><br/>
<span>some woodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat</span><br/>
<span>start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on</span><br/>
<span>accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would</span><br/>
<span>a done it.  I wished the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be</span><br/>
<span>proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and</span><br/>
<span>dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest</span><br/>
<span>in.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along</span><br/>
<span>down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for</span><br/>
<span>her.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much chance</span><br/>
<span>for anybody being alive in her.  I pulled all around her and hollered</span><br/>
<span>a little, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still.  I felt a little</span><br/>
<span>bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they</span><br/>
<span>could stand it I could.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river</span><br/>
<span>on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach</span><br/>
<span>I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the</span><br/>
<span>wreck for Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know her</span><br/>
<span>uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give</span><br/>
<span>it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming</span><br/>
<span>down the river.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and when</span><br/>
<span>it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.  By the time I</span><br/>
<span>got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we</span><br/>
<span>struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned</span><br/>
<span>in and slept like dead people.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XIV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole</span><br/>
<span>off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all</span><br/>
<span>sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three</span><br/>
<span>boxes of seegars.  We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither of</span><br/>
<span>our lives.  The seegars was prime.  We laid off all the afternoon in the</span><br/>
<span>woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good</span><br/>
<span>time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the</span><br/>
<span>ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said</span><br/>
<span>he didn’t want no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the</span><br/>
<span>texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he</span><br/>
<span>nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could</span><br/>
<span>be fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get drownded; and if he</span><br/>
<span>did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get</span><br/>
<span>the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.  Well, he</span><br/>
<span>was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a</span><br/>
<span>nigger.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and</span><br/>
<span>how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each</span><br/>
<span>other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, ‘stead</span><br/>
<span>of mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I didn’ know dey was so many un um.  I hain’t hearn ‘bout none un um,</span><br/>
<span>skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat’s in a</span><br/>
<span>pack er k’yards.  How much do a king git?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Get?”  I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want</span><br/>
<span>it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to</span><br/>
<span>them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Ain’_ dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_They_ don’t do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set around.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No; is dat so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Of course it is.  They just set around--except, maybe, when there’s a</span><br/>
<span>war; then they go to the war.  But other times they just lazy around; or</span><br/>
<span>go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d’ you hear a noise?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We skipped out and looked; but it warn’t nothing but the flutter of a</span><br/>
<span>steamboat’s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the</span><br/>
<span>parlyment; and if everybody don’t go just so he whacks their heads off.</span><br/>
<span>But mostly they hang round the harem.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Roun’ de which?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Harem.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s de harem?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The place where he keeps his wives.  Don’t you know about the harem?</span><br/>
<span>Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, yes, dat’s so; I--I’d done forgot it.  A harem’s a bo’d’n-house, I</span><br/>
<span>reck’n.  Mos’ likely dey has rackety times in de nussery.  En I reck’n</span><br/>
<span>de wives quarrels considable; en dat ‘crease de racket.  Yit dey say</span><br/>
<span>Sollermun de wises’ man dat ever live’.  I doan’ take no stock in</span><br/>
<span>dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids’ er sich a</span><br/>
<span>blim-blammin’ all de time?  No--‘deed he wouldn’t.  A wise man ‘ud take</span><br/>
<span>en buil’ a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry</span><br/>
<span>when he want to res’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told</span><br/>
<span>me so, her own self.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I doan k’yer what de widder say, he _warn’t_ no wise man nuther.  He</span><br/>
<span>had some er de dad-fetchedes’ ways I ever see.  Does you know ‘bout dat</span><br/>
<span>chile dat he ‘uz gwyne to chop in two?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, the widow told me all about it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Well_, den!  Warn’ dat de beatenes’ notion in de worl’?  You jes’</span><br/>
<span>take en look at it a minute.  Dah’s de stump, dah--dat’s one er de women;</span><br/>
<span>heah’s you--dat’s de yuther one; I’s Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill’s</span><br/>
<span>de chile.  Bofe un you claims it.  What does I do?  Does I shin aroun’</span><br/>
<span>mongs’ de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b’long to, en</span><br/>
<span>han’ it over to de right one, all safe en soun’, de way dat anybody dat</span><br/>
<span>had any gumption would?  No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give</span><br/>
<span>half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.  Dat’s de way</span><br/>
<span>Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.  Now I want to ast you:  what’s</span><br/>
<span>de use er dat half a bill?--can’t buy noth’n wid it.  En what use is a</span><br/>
<span>half a chile?  I wouldn’ give a dern for a million un um.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But hang it, Jim, you’ve clean missed the point--blame it, you’ve missed</span><br/>
<span>it a thousand mile.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who?  Me?  Go ‘long.  Doan’ talk to me ‘bout yo’ pints.  I reck’n I</span><br/>
<span>knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain’ no sense in sich doin’s as</span><br/>
<span>dat. De ‘spute warn’t ‘bout a half a chile, de ‘spute was ‘bout a whole</span><br/>
<span>chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a ‘spute ‘bout a whole chile</span><br/>
<span>wid a half a chile doan’ know enough to come in out’n de rain.  Doan’</span><br/>
<span>talk to me ‘bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I tell you you don’t get the point.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blame de point!  I reck’n I knows what I knows.  En mine you, de _real_</span><br/>
<span>pint is down furder--it’s down deeper.  It lays in de way Sollermun was</span><br/>
<span>raised.  You take a man dat’s got on’y one or two chillen; is dat man</span><br/>
<span>gwyne to be waseful o’ chillen?  No, he ain’t; he can’t ‘ford it.  _He_</span><br/>
<span>know how to value ‘em.  But you take a man dat’s got ‘bout five million</span><br/>
<span>chillen runnin’ roun’ de house, en it’s diffunt.  _He_ as soon chop a</span><br/>
<span>chile in two as a cat. Dey’s plenty mo’.  A chile er two, mo’ er less,</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I never see such a nigger.  If he got a notion in his head once, there</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no getting it out again.  He was the most down on Solomon of</span><br/>
<span>any nigger I ever see.  So I went to talking about other kings, and let</span><br/>
<span>Solomon slide.  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off</span><br/>
<span>in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that</span><br/>
<span>would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say</span><br/>
<span>he died there.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Po’ little chap.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dat’s good!  But he’ll be pooty lonesome--dey ain’ no kings here, is</span><br/>
<span>dey, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Den he cain’t git no situation.  What he gwyne to do?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I don’t know.  Some of them gets on the police, and some of them</span><br/>
<span>learns people how to talk French.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Huck, doan’ de French people talk de same way we does?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_No_, Jim; you couldn’t understand a word they said--not a single word.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, now, I be ding-busted!  How do dat come?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know; but it’s so.  I got some of their jabber out of a book.</span><br/>
<span>S’pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you</span><br/>
<span>think?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wouldn’ think nuff’n; I’d take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he</span><br/>
<span>warn’t white.  I wouldn’t ‘low no nigger to call me dat.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks, it ain’t calling you anything.  It’s only saying, do you know</span><br/>
<span>how to talk French?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, why couldn’t he _say_ it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, he _is_ a-saying it.  That’s a Frenchman’s _way_ of saying it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it’s a blame ridicklous way, en I doan’ want to hear no mo’ ‘bout</span><br/>
<span>it.  Dey ain’ no sense in it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, a cat don’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, does a cow?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, a cow don’t, nuther.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, dey don’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s natural and right for ‘em to talk different from each other, ain’t</span><br/>
<span>it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Course.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And ain’t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different</span><br/>
<span>from _us_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, mos’ sholy it is.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, why ain’t it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk</span><br/>
<span>different from us?  You answer me that.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is a cat a man, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, dey ain’t no sense in a cat talkin’ like a man.  Is a cow a</span><br/>
<span>man?--er is a cow a cat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, she ain’t either of them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, she ain’t got no business to talk like either one er the</span><br/>
<span>yuther of ‘em.  Is a Frenchman a man?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Well_, den!  Dad blame it, why doan’ he _talk_ like a man?  You answer</span><br/>
<span>me _dat_!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see it warn’t no use wasting words--you can’t learn a nigger to argue.</span><br/>
<span>So I quit.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom</span><br/>
<span>of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was</span><br/>
<span>after.  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the</span><br/>
<span>Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead</span><br/>
<span>to tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled</span><br/>
<span>ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’t anything</span><br/>
<span>but little saplings to tie to.  I passed the line around one of them</span><br/>
<span>right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and</span><br/>
<span>the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and</span><br/>
<span>away she went.  I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and</span><br/>
<span>scared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and</span><br/>
<span>then there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty yards.  I</span><br/>
<span>jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle</span><br/>
<span>and set her back a stroke.  But she didn’t come.  I was in such a hurry</span><br/>
<span>I hadn’t untied her.  I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so</span><br/>
<span>excited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything with them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right</span><br/>
<span>down the towhead.  That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead</span><br/>
<span>warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot</span><br/>
<span>out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea which way I was</span><br/>
<span>going than a dead man.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank</span><br/>
<span>or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’s</span><br/>
<span>mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.</span><br/>
<span>I whooped and listened.  Away down there somewheres I hears a small</span><br/>
<span>whoop, and up comes my spirits.  I went tearing after it, listening</span><br/>
<span>sharp to hear it again.  The next time it come I see I warn’t heading</span><br/>
<span>for it, but heading away to the right of it.  And the next time I was</span><br/>
<span>heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for</span><br/>
<span>I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it was going</span><br/>
<span>straight ahead all the time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the</span><br/>
<span>time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops</span><br/>
<span>that was making the trouble for me.  Well, I fought along, and directly</span><br/>
<span>I hears the whoop _behind_ me.  I was tangled good now.  That was</span><br/>
<span>somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was behind me</span><br/>
<span>yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its</span><br/>
<span>place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,</span><br/>
<span>and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and I</span><br/>
<span>was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.</span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t look</span><br/>
<span>natural nor sound natural in a fog.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a</span><br/>
<span>cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed</span><br/>
<span>me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly</span><br/>
<span>roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In another second or two it was solid white and still again.  I set</span><br/>
<span>perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut bank</span><br/>
<span>was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it.  It warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had the big timber</span><br/>
<span>of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than</span><br/>
<span>half a mile wide.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.  I</span><br/>
<span>was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t</span><br/>
<span>ever think of that.  No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on</span><br/>
<span>the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to</span><br/>
<span>yourself how fast _you’re_ going, but you catch your breath and think,</span><br/>
<span>my! how that snag’s tearing along.  If you think it ain’t dismal and</span><br/>
<span>lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it</span><br/>
<span>once--you’ll see.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears</span><br/>
<span>the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do</span><br/>
<span>it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of towheads, for I had</span><br/>
<span>little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow</span><br/>
<span>channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was there because</span><br/>
<span>I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash</span><br/>
<span>that hung over the banks.  Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoops down</span><br/>
<span>amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,</span><br/>
<span>anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern.  You never</span><br/>
<span>knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to</span><br/>
<span>keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the</span><br/>
<span>raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would</span><br/>
<span>get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little</span><br/>
<span>faster than what I was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a</span><br/>
<span>snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was good and tired, so I</span><br/>
<span>laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more.  I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t help it;</span><br/>
<span>so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars</span><br/>
<span>was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a</span><br/>
<span>big bend stern first.  First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was</span><br/>
<span>dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come</span><br/>
<span>up dim out of last week.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest</span><br/>
<span>kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see</span><br/>
<span>by the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the</span><br/>
<span>water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a</span><br/>
<span>couple of sawlogs made fast together.  Then I see another speck, and</span><br/>
<span>chased that; then another, and this time I was right.  It was the raft.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his</span><br/>
<span>knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.  The</span><br/>
<span>other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and</span><br/>
<span>branches and dirt.  So she’d had a rough time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began to</span><br/>
<span>gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn’t you stir me up?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain’ dead--you ain’</span><br/>
<span>drownded--you’s back agin?  It’s too good for true, honey, it’s too good</span><br/>
<span>for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o’ you.  No, you ain’</span><br/>
<span>dead! you’s back agin, ‘live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck--de same ole</span><br/>
<span>Huck, thanks to goodness!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Drinkin’?  Has I ben a-drinkin’?  Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin’?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How does I talk wild?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_How_?  Why, hain’t you been talking about my coming back, and all that</span><br/>
<span>stuff, as if I’d been gone away?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.  _Hain’t_ you</span><br/>
<span>ben gone away?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain’t been gone</span><br/>
<span>anywheres.  Where would I go to?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is.  Is I _me_, or who</span><br/>
<span>_is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?  Now dat’s what I wants to know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re a</span><br/>
<span>tangle-headed old fool, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn’t you tote out de line in</span><br/>
<span>de canoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, I didn’t.  What tow-head?  I hain’t see no tow-head.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You hain’t seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn’t de line pull loose en</span><br/>
<span>de raf’ go a-hummin’ down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in</span><br/>
<span>de fog?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What fog?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, de fog!--de fog dat’s been aroun’ all night.  En didn’t you whoop,</span><br/>
<span>en didn’t I whoop, tell we got mix’ up in de islands en one un us got</span><br/>
<span>los’ en t’other one was jis’ as good as los’, ‘kase he didn’ know whah</span><br/>
<span>he wuz? En didn’t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible</span><br/>
<span>time en mos’ git drownded?  Now ain’ dat so, boss--ain’t it so?  You</span><br/>
<span>answer me dat.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain’t seen no fog, nor no</span><br/>
<span>islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting here talking with</span><br/>
<span>you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon</span><br/>
<span>I done the same.  You couldn’t a got drunk in that time, so of course</span><br/>
<span>you’ve been dreaming.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any of it</span><br/>
<span>happen.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t nothing in it.</span><br/>
<span>I know, because I’ve been here all the time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying</span><br/>
<span>over it.  Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain’t</span><br/>
<span>de powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain’t ever had no dream b’fo’</span><br/>
<span>dat’s tired me like dis one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body like</span><br/>
<span>everything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream; tell me all</span><br/>
<span>about it, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as</span><br/>
<span>it happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he said he must</span><br/>
<span>start in and “‘terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.  He said</span><br/>
<span>the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but</span><br/>
<span>the current was another man that would get us away from him.  The whoops</span><br/>
<span>was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn’t</span><br/>
<span>try hard to make out to understand them they’d just take us into bad</span><br/>
<span>luck, ‘stead of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles</span><br/>
<span>we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean</span><br/>
<span>folks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back and aggravate</span><br/>
<span>them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big</span><br/>
<span>clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have no more</span><br/>
<span>trouble.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it</span><br/>
<span>was clearing up again now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” I</span><br/>
<span>says; “but what does _these_ things stand for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.  You</span><br/>
<span>could see them first-rate now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash</span><br/>
<span>again.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place</span><br/>
<span>again right away.  But when he did get the thing straightened around he</span><br/>
<span>looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do dey stan’ for?  I’se gwyne to tell you.  When I got all wore</span><br/>
<span>out wid work, en wid de callin’ for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz</span><br/>
<span>mos’ broke bekase you wuz los’, en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become</span><br/>
<span>er me en de raf’.  En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe</span><br/>
<span>en soun’, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo’</span><br/>
<span>foot, I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin’ ‘bout wuz how you could</span><br/>
<span>make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash</span><br/>
<span>is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren’s en makes ‘em</span><br/>
<span>ashamed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without</span><br/>
<span>saying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It made me feel so mean</span><br/>
<span>I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble</span><br/>
<span>myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for it</span><br/>
<span>afterwards, neither.  I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and I</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him feel that way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XVI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a</span><br/>
<span>monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.  She had</span><br/>
<span>four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty</span><br/>
<span>men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open</span><br/>
<span>camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a</span><br/>
<span>power of style about her.  It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman</span><br/>
<span>on such a craft as that.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got</span><br/>
<span>hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on</span><br/>
<span>both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.  We</span><br/>
<span>talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to</span><br/>
<span>it.  I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’t but</span><br/>
<span>about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have them lit</span><br/>
<span>up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two</span><br/>
<span>big rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe</span><br/>
<span>we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the</span><br/>
<span>same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too.  So the question</span><br/>
<span>was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,</span><br/>
<span>and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and</span><br/>
<span>was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to</span><br/>
<span>Cairo.  Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and</span><br/>
<span>waited.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and</span><br/>
<span>not pass it without seeing it.  He said he’d be mighty sure to see it,</span><br/>
<span>because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it</span><br/>
<span>he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.  Every</span><br/>
<span>little while he jumps up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dah she is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But it warn’t.  It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set</span><br/>
<span>down again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim said it made him</span><br/>
<span>all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.  Well, I can</span><br/>
<span>tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,</span><br/>
<span>because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and</span><br/>
<span>who was to blame for it?  Why, _me_.  I couldn’t get that out of my</span><br/>
<span>conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>rest; I couldn’t stay still in one place.  It hadn’t ever come home to</span><br/>
<span>me before, what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it</span><br/>
<span>stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make out to</span><br/>
<span>myself that I warn’t to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his</span><br/>
<span>rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every</span><br/>
<span>time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a</span><br/>
<span>paddled ashore and told somebody.”  That was so--I couldn’t get around</span><br/>
<span>that noway.  That was where it pinched.  Conscience says to me, “What</span><br/>
<span>had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off</span><br/>
<span>right under your eyes and never say one single word?  What did that poor</span><br/>
<span>old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to</span><br/>
<span>learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to</span><br/>
<span>be good to you every way she knowed how.  _That’s_ what she done.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.  I</span><br/>
<span>fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was</span><br/>
<span>fidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us could keep still.</span><br/>
<span>Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me</span><br/>
<span>like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of</span><br/>
<span>miserableness.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.  He was</span><br/>
<span>saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he</span><br/>
<span>would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he</span><br/>
<span>got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to</span><br/>
<span>where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the</span><br/>
<span>two children, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an</span><br/>
<span>Ab’litionist to go and steal them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn’t ever dared to talk such</span><br/>
<span>talk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it made in him the</span><br/>
<span>minute he judged he was about free.  It was according to the old saying,</span><br/>
<span>“Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.”  Thinks I, this is what</span><br/>
<span>comes of my not thinking.  Here was this nigger, which I had as good</span><br/>
<span>as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would</span><br/>
<span>steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a</span><br/>
<span>man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.  My</span><br/>
<span>conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says</span><br/>
<span>to it, “Let up on me--it ain’t too late yet--I’ll paddle ashore at the</span><br/>
<span>first light and tell.”  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather</span><br/>
<span>right off.  All my troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a</span><br/>
<span>light, and sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings</span><br/>
<span>out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe!  Jump up and crack yo’ heels!  Dat’s de</span><br/>
<span>good ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn’t be, you know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom</span><br/>
<span>for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on</span><br/>
<span>accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef it</span><br/>
<span>hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck;</span><br/>
<span>you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de _only_ fren’ ole Jim’s</span><br/>
<span>got now.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says</span><br/>
<span>this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I went along</span><br/>
<span>slow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started</span><br/>
<span>or whether I warn’t.  When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’ his</span><br/>
<span>promise to ole Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I just felt sick.  But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can’t get _out_</span><br/>
<span>of it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and</span><br/>
<span>they stopped and I stopped.  One of them says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s that yonder?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A piece of a raft,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Do you belong on it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, sir.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Any men on it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Only one, sir.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head</span><br/>
<span>of the bend.  Is your man white or black?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come. I</span><br/>
<span>tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t man</span><br/>
<span>enough--hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit.  I see I was weakening; so I just</span><br/>
<span>give up trying, and up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He’s white.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybe</span><br/>
<span>you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.  He’s sick--and so</span><br/>
<span>is mam and Mary Ann.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy.  But I s’pose we’ve got to.</span><br/>
<span>Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we had made a</span><br/>
<span>stroke or two, I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.  Everybody goes</span><br/>
<span>away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do it</span><br/>
<span>by myself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that’s infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what’s the matter</span><br/>
<span>with your father?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s the--a--the--well, it ain’t anything much.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They stopped pulling.  It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft</span><br/>
<span>now. One says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Boy, that’s a lie.  What _is_ the matter with your pap?  Answer up</span><br/>
<span>square now, and it’ll be the better for you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I will, sir, I will, honest--but don’t leave us, please.  It’s</span><br/>
<span>the--the--Gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the</span><br/>
<span>headline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft--please do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.  They backed water.  “Keep</span><br/>
<span>away, boy--keep to looard.  Confound it, I just expect the wind has</span><br/>
<span>blowed it to us.  Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it precious</span><br/>
<span>well.  Why didn’t you come out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all</span><br/>
<span>over?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and they just</span><br/>
<span>went away and left us.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Poor devil, there’s something in that.  We are right down sorry for</span><br/>
<span>you, but we--well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see.  Look</span><br/>
<span>here, I’ll tell you what to do.  Don’t you try to land by yourself, or</span><br/>
<span>you’ll smash everything to pieces.  You float along down about twenty</span><br/>
<span>miles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It</span><br/>
<span>will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them</span><br/>
<span>your folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don’t be a fool again,</span><br/>
<span>and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we’re trying to do you a</span><br/>
<span>kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy.</span><br/>
<span>It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is--it’s only a</span><br/>
<span>wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’s</span><br/>
<span>in pretty hard luck.  Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this</span><br/>
<span>board, and you get it when it floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave</span><br/>
<span>you; but my kingdom! it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on the</span><br/>
<span>board for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’ll</span><br/>
<span>be all right.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any runaway niggers</span><br/>
<span>you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway niggers get by me if I</span><br/>
<span>can help it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I</span><br/>
<span>knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me</span><br/>
<span>to try to learn to do right; a body that don’t get _started_ right when</span><br/>
<span>he’s little ain’t got no show--when the pinch comes there ain’t nothing</span><br/>
<span>to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I</span><br/>
<span>thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a done right</span><br/>
<span>and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says</span><br/>
<span>I, I’d feel bad--I’d feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says</span><br/>
<span>I, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do</span><br/>
<span>right and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?</span><br/>
<span>I was stuck.  I couldn’t answer that.  So I reckoned I wouldn’t bother</span><br/>
<span>no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at</span><br/>
<span>the time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there.  I looked all around; he</span><br/>
<span>warn’t anywhere.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jim!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o’ sight yit?  Don’t talk loud.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.  I told</span><br/>
<span>him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne</span><br/>
<span>to shove for sho’ if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne to swim to de</span><br/>
<span>raf’ agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you did fool ‘em, Huck!</span><br/>
<span>Dat _wuz_ de smartes’ dodge!  I tell you, chile, I’spec it save’ ole</span><br/>
<span>Jim--ole Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good raise--twenty</span><br/>
<span>dollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat</span><br/>
<span>now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free</span><br/>
<span>States. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but he</span><br/>
<span>wished we was already there.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding</span><br/>
<span>the raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and</span><br/>
<span>getting all ready to quit rafting.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down</span><br/>
<span>in a left-hand bend.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found a man out</span><br/>
<span>in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I ranged up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mister, is that town Cairo?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cairo? no.  You must be a blame’ fool.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What town is it, mister?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here botherin’</span><br/>
<span>around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something you</span><br/>
<span>won’t want.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never</span><br/>
<span>mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but</span><br/>
<span>it was high ground, so I didn’t go.  No high ground about Cairo, Jim</span><br/>
<span>said. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable</span><br/>
<span>close to the left-hand bank.  I begun to suspicion something.  So did</span><br/>
<span>Jim.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck.  Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.  I</span><br/>
<span>awluz ‘spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I’d never laid</span><br/>
<span>eyes on it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know.  Don’t you blame yo’self</span><br/>
<span>‘bout it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure</span><br/>
<span>enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with</span><br/>
<span>Cairo.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We talked it all over.  It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn’t no way but to wait</span><br/>
<span>for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept</span><br/>
<span>all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,</span><br/>
<span>and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We didn’t say a word for a good while.  There warn’t anything to</span><br/>
<span>say.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the</span><br/>
<span>rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would only</span><br/>
<span>look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more</span><br/>
<span>bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep</span><br/>
<span>still.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy</span><br/>
<span>a canoe to go back in.  We warn’t going to borrow it when there warn’t</span><br/>
<span>anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after</span><br/>
<span>us.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Anybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle a</span><br/>
<span>snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it</span><br/>
<span>now if they read on and see what more it done for us.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we</span><br/>
<span>didn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and</span><br/>
<span>more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next</span><br/>
<span>meanest thing to fog.  You can’t tell the shape of the river, and you</span><br/>
<span>can’t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along</span><br/>
<span>comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she</span><br/>
<span>would see it.  Up-stream boats didn’t generly come close to us; they</span><br/>
<span>go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but</span><br/>
<span>nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till she</span><br/>
<span>was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see</span><br/>
<span>how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off</span><br/>
<span>a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks</span><br/>
<span>he’s mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to</span><br/>
<span>try and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be sheering off a bit.  She</span><br/>
<span>was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black</span><br/>
<span>cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged</span><br/>
<span>out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining</span><br/>
<span>like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right</span><br/>
<span>over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the</span><br/>
<span>engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went</span><br/>
<span>overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight</span><br/>
<span>through the raft.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel</span><br/>
<span>had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could</span><br/>
<span>always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a</span><br/>
<span>minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was</span><br/>
<span>nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of</span><br/>
<span>my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and</span><br/>
<span>of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she</span><br/>
<span>stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was</span><br/>
<span>churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I</span><br/>
<span>could hear her.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer;</span><br/>
<span>so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and</span><br/>
<span>struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see</span><br/>
<span>that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which</span><br/>
<span>meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good</span><br/>
<span>long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the</span><br/>
<span>bank. I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over</span><br/>
<span>rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a</span><br/>
<span>big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to</span><br/>
<span>rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling</span><br/>
<span>and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XVII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his</span><br/>
<span>head out, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Be done, boys!  Who’s there?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who’s me?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“George Jackson, sir.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do you want?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but the dogs</span><br/>
<span>won’t let me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I warn’t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What did you</span><br/>
<span>say your name was?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“George Jackson, sir.  I’m only a boy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be afraid--nobody’ll</span><br/>
<span>hurt you.  But don’t try to budge; stand right where you are.  Rouse out</span><br/>
<span>Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there</span><br/>
<span>anybody with you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sir, nobody.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.</span><br/>
<span>The man sung out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain’t you got any sense?</span><br/>
<span>Put it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob, if you and Tom are</span><br/>
<span>ready, take your places.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All ready.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sir; I never heard of them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that may be so, and it mayn’t.  Now, all ready.  Step forward,</span><br/>
<span>George Jackson.  And mind, don’t you hurry--come mighty slow.  If there’s</span><br/>
<span>anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he’ll be shot.</span><br/>
<span>Come along now.  Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to</span><br/>
<span>squeeze in, d’ you hear?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to.  I took one slow step at</span><br/>
<span>a time and there warn’t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.</span><br/>
<span>The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind</span><br/>
<span>me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and</span><br/>
<span>unbarring and unbolting.  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a</span><br/>
<span>little and a little more till somebody said, “There, that’s enough--put</span><br/>
<span>your head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and</span><br/>
<span>me at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three big men with guns</span><br/>
<span>pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray</span><br/>
<span>and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and</span><br/>
<span>handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two</span><br/>
<span>young women which I couldn’t see right well.  The old gentleman says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“There; I reckon it’s all right.  Come in.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it</span><br/>
<span>and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and</span><br/>
<span>they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,</span><br/>
<span>and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front</span><br/>
<span>windows--there warn’t none on the side.  They held the candle, and took a</span><br/>
<span>good look at me, and all said, “Why, _he_ ain’t a Shepherdson--no, there</span><br/>
<span>ain’t any Shepherdson about him.”  Then the old man said he hoped I</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he didn’t mean no harm by</span><br/>
<span>it--it was only to make sure.  So he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only</span><br/>
<span>felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.  He told me to</span><br/>
<span>make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old</span><br/>
<span>lady says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be; and don’t</span><br/>
<span>you reckon it may be he’s hungry?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“True for you, Rachel--I forgot.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the old lady says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Betsy” <i>(this was a nigger woman)</i>, “you fly around and get him something</span><br/>
<span>to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake</span><br/>
<span>up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself.  Buck, take this little</span><br/>
<span>stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some</span><br/>
<span>of yours that’s dry.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,</span><br/>
<span>though he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn’t on anything but a</span><br/>
<span>shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in gaping and digging one</span><br/>
<span>fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.</span><br/>
<span>He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They said, no, ‘twas a false alarm.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d a got one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They all laughed, and Bob says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so slow in</span><br/>
<span>coming.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m always kept down; I</span><br/>
<span>don’t get no show.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll have show enough,</span><br/>
<span>all in good time, don’t you fret about that.  Go ‘long with you now, and</span><br/>
<span>do as your mother told you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a</span><br/>
<span>roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at it he</span><br/>
<span>asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to</span><br/>
<span>tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods</span><br/>
<span>day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle</span><br/>
<span>went out.  I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it before, no way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, guess,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never heard tell of it</span><br/>
<span>before?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But you can guess, can’t you?  It’s just as easy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Which_ candle?”  I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, any candle,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, he was in the _dark_!  That’s where he was!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see?  Say, how long are you</span><br/>
<span>going to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just have booming</span><br/>
<span>times--they don’t have no school now.  Do you own a dog?  I’ve got a</span><br/>
<span>dog--and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.  Do</span><br/>
<span>you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet</span><br/>
<span>I don’t, but ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon</span><br/>
<span>I’d better put ‘em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm.  Are you all</span><br/>
<span>ready? All right.  Come along, old hoss.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they</span><br/>
<span>had for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever I’ve</span><br/>
<span>come across yet.  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,</span><br/>
<span>except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They</span><br/>
<span>all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had</span><br/>
<span>quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me</span><br/>
<span>questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living</span><br/>
<span>on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann</span><br/>
<span>run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went</span><br/>
<span>to hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,</span><br/>
<span>and then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just</span><br/>
<span>trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died</span><br/>
<span>I took what there was left, because the farm didn’t belong to us, and</span><br/>
<span>started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how</span><br/>
<span>I come to be here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I</span><br/>
<span>wanted it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I</span><br/>
<span>went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,</span><br/>
<span>I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to</span><br/>
<span>think, and when Buck waked up I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Can you spell, Buck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think you could.  It ain’t no</span><br/>
<span>slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it</span><br/>
<span>next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was</span><br/>
<span>used to it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much</span><br/>
<span>style.  It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one</span><br/>
<span>with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in</span><br/>
<span>town. There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps</span><br/>
<span>of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that</span><br/>
<span>was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by</span><br/>
<span>pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes</span><br/>
<span>they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,</span><br/>
<span>same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold</span><br/>
<span>up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with</span><br/>
<span>a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and</span><br/>
<span>a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the</span><br/>
<span>pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;</span><br/>
<span>and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her</span><br/>
<span>up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred</span><br/>
<span>and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn’t took any money for</span><br/>
<span>her.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,</span><br/>
<span>made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the</span><br/>
<span>parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;</span><br/>
<span>and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open</span><br/>
<span>their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through</span><br/>
<span>underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out</span><br/>
<span>behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind</span><br/>
<span>of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and</span><br/>
<span>grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier</span><br/>
<span>than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where</span><br/>
<span>pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it</span><br/>
<span>was, underneath.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and</span><br/>
<span>blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It</span><br/>
<span>come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,</span><br/>
<span>too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a</span><br/>
<span>big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about a</span><br/>
<span>man that left his family, it didn’t say why.  I read considerable in it</span><br/>
<span>now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was</span><br/>
<span>Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr.</span><br/>
<span>Gunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body</span><br/>
<span>was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And</span><br/>
<span>there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged</span><br/>
<span>down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,</span><br/>
<span>and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the</span><br/>
<span>Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the</span><br/>
<span>daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only</span><br/>
<span>fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see</span><br/>
<span>before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black</span><br/>
<span>dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in</span><br/>
<span>the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with</span><br/>
<span>a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and</span><br/>
<span>very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a</span><br/>
<span>tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand</span><br/>
<span>hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,</span><br/>
<span>and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”</span><br/>
<span>Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight</span><br/>
<span>to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a</span><br/>
<span>chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird</span><br/>
<span>laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath</span><br/>
<span>the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”</span><br/>
<span>There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the</span><br/>
<span>moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in</span><br/>
<span>one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was</span><br/>
<span>mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath</span><br/>
<span>the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  These</span><br/>
<span>was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take</span><br/>
<span>to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the</span><br/>
<span>fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot</span><br/>
<span>more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done</span><br/>
<span>what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was</span><br/>
<span>having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they</span><br/>
<span>said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and</span><br/>
<span>every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it</span><br/>
<span>done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman</span><br/>
<span>in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump</span><br/>
<span>off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with</span><br/>
<span>the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her</span><br/>
<span>breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up</span><br/>
<span>towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,</span><br/>
<span>and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died</span><br/>
<span>before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the</span><br/>
<span>head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung</span><br/>
<span>flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young</span><br/>
<span>woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so</span><br/>
<span>many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste</span><br/>
<span>obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the</span><br/>
<span>Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.</span><br/>
<span>It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name</span><br/>
<span>of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die? And did the</span><br/>
<span>sad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad</span><br/>
<span>hearts round him thickened,    ‘Twas not from sickness’ shots.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;</span><br/>
<span>Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots, Nor</span><br/>
<span>stomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>O no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul</span><br/>
<span>did from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late; His spirit</span><br/>
<span>was gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was</span><br/>
<span>fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck</span><br/>
<span>said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She didn’t ever have to</span><br/>
<span>stop to think.  He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down</span><br/>
<span>another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular; she could write about</span><br/>
<span>anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.</span><br/>
<span>Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on</span><br/>
<span>hand with her “tribute” before he was cold.  She called them tributes.</span><br/>
<span>The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the</span><br/>
<span>undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and</span><br/>
<span>then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name, which was</span><br/>
<span>Whistler.  She warn’t ever the same after that; she never complained,</span><br/>
<span>but she kinder pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many’s the</span><br/>
<span>time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get</span><br/>
<span>out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been</span><br/>
<span>aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that</span><br/>
<span>family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to let anything come between</span><br/>
<span>us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was</span><br/>
<span>alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some</span><br/>
<span>about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two</span><br/>
<span>myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow.  They kept Emmeline’s</span><br/>
<span>room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she</span><br/>
<span>liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.</span><br/>
<span>The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty</span><br/>
<span>of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there</span><br/>
<span>mostly.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on</span><br/>
<span>the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines</span><br/>
<span>all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little</span><br/>
<span>old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever</span><br/>
<span>so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”</span><br/>
<span>and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.  The walls of all the rooms was</span><br/>
<span>plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was</span><br/>
<span>whitewashed on the outside.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed</span><br/>
<span>and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the</span><br/>
<span>day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing couldn’t be better.</span><br/>
<span>And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XVIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all</span><br/>
<span>over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and</span><br/>
<span>that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas</span><br/>
<span>said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy</span><br/>
<span>in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more</span><br/>
<span>quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and</span><br/>
<span>very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it</span><br/>
<span>anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and</span><br/>
<span>he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and</span><br/>
<span>a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so</span><br/>
<span>deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at</span><br/>
<span>you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and</span><br/>
<span>straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and</span><br/>
<span>every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head</span><br/>
<span>to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;</span><br/>
<span>and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He</span><br/>
<span>carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud.  He was</span><br/>
<span>as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had</span><br/>
<span>confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he</span><br/>
<span>straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to</span><br/>
<span>flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,</span><br/>
<span>and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn’t ever have to</span><br/>
<span>tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered</span><br/>
<span>where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine</span><br/>
<span>most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned</span><br/>
<span>into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was</span><br/>
<span>enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got</span><br/>
<span>up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down again</span><br/>
<span>till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where</span><br/>
<span>the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and</span><br/>
<span>he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was mixed, and</span><br/>
<span>then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_</span><br/>
<span>bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,</span><br/>
<span>all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and</span><br/>
<span>the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and</span><br/>
<span>give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad</span><br/>
<span>shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They</span><br/>
<span>dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and</span><br/>
<span>wore broad Panama hats.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud</span><br/>
<span>and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but</span><br/>
<span>when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,</span><br/>
<span>like her father.  She was beautiful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was</span><br/>
<span>gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger</span><br/>
<span>had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody do</span><br/>
<span>anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be</span><br/>
<span>more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.</span><br/>
<span>Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or</span><br/>
<span>fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings</span><br/>
<span>round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods</span><br/>
<span>daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly</span><br/>
<span>kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a</span><br/>
<span>handsome lot of quality, I tell you.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six</span><br/>
<span>families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned</span><br/>
<span>and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The</span><br/>
<span>Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was</span><br/>
<span>about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a</span><br/>
<span>lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their</span><br/>
<span>fine horses.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse</span><br/>
<span>coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his</span><br/>
<span>horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his</span><br/>
<span>pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I</span><br/>
<span>heard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from his</span><br/>
<span>head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was</span><br/>
<span>hid.  But we didn’t wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The</span><br/>
<span>woods warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,</span><br/>
<span>and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away</span><br/>
<span>the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see.  We never</span><br/>
<span>stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a</span><br/>
<span>minute--‘twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed</span><br/>
<span>down, and he says, kind of gentle:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn’t you step</span><br/>
<span>into the road, my boy?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The Shepherdsons don’t, father.  They always take advantage.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling</span><br/>
<span>his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young</span><br/>
<span>men looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,</span><br/>
<span>but the color come back when she found the man warn’t hurt.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by</span><br/>
<span>ourselves, I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I bet I did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did he do to you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Him?  He never done nothing to me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, nothing--only it’s on account of the feud.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s a feud?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, where was you raised?  Don’t you know what a feud is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Never heard of it before--tell me about it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with</span><br/>
<span>another man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills _him_;</span><br/>
<span>then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the</span><br/>
<span>_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’t</span><br/>
<span>no more feud.  But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som’ers along</span><br/>
<span>there.  There was trouble ‘bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle</span><br/>
<span>it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the</span><br/>
<span>man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody</span><br/>
<span>would.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon maybe--I don’t know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t anybody know?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they</span><br/>
<span>don’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Has there been many killed, Buck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don’t always kill.  Pa’s</span><br/>
<span>got a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ‘cuz he don’t weigh</span><br/>
<span>much, anyway.  Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been</span><br/>
<span>hurt once or twice.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes; we got one and they got one.  ‘Bout three months ago my cousin</span><br/>
<span>Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other side</span><br/>
<span>of the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’</span><br/>
<span>foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind</span><br/>
<span>him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun in</span><br/>
<span>his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ‘stead of jumping</span><br/>
<span>off and taking to the brush, Bud ‘lowed he could out-run him; so they</span><br/>
<span>had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all</span><br/>
<span>the time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped and faced</span><br/>
<span>around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old</span><br/>
<span>man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn’t git much chance to</span><br/>
<span>enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon he _warn’t_ a coward.  Not by a blame’ sight.  There ain’t a</span><br/>
<span>coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain’t no cowards</span><br/>
<span>amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a</span><br/>
<span>fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come</span><br/>
<span>out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got</span><br/>
<span>behind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the</span><br/>
<span>bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around</span><br/>
<span>the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.</span><br/>
<span>Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the</span><br/>
<span>Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of ‘em was dead, and</span><br/>
<span>another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowards</span><br/>
<span>he don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz</span><br/>
<span>they don’t breed any of that _kind_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody</span><br/>
<span>a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept</span><br/>
<span>them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The</span><br/>
<span>Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about</span><br/>
<span>brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was</span><br/>
<span>a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such</span><br/>
<span>a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and</span><br/>
<span>preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to me</span><br/>
<span>to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their</span><br/>
<span>chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and</span><br/>
<span>a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up</span><br/>
<span>to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet</span><br/>
<span>Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took</span><br/>
<span>me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,</span><br/>
<span>and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and</span><br/>
<span>not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she’d forgot her</span><br/>
<span>Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,</span><br/>
<span>and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say</span><br/>
<span>nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the</span><br/>
<span>road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,</span><br/>
<span>for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor</span><br/>
<span>in summer-time because it’s cool.  If you notice, most folks don’t go to</span><br/>
<span>church only when they’ve got to; but a hog is different.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be in</span><br/>
<span>such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a</span><br/>
<span>little piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil.  I</span><br/>
<span>ransacked it, but couldn’t find anything else.  I couldn’t make anything</span><br/>
<span>out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home</span><br/>
<span>and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She</span><br/>
<span>pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till</span><br/>
<span>she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and</span><br/>
<span>before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and</span><br/>
<span>said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was</span><br/>
<span>mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it</span><br/>
<span>made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got</span><br/>
<span>my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I</span><br/>
<span>had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,</span><br/>
<span>and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper</span><br/>
<span>warn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and</span><br/>
<span>play now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon</span><br/>
<span>I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out</span><br/>
<span>of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes</span><br/>
<span>a-running, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole</span><br/>
<span>stack o’ water-moccasins.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter</span><br/>
<span>know a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for</span><br/>
<span>them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right; trot ahead.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded</span><br/>
<span>ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece</span><br/>
<span>of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,</span><br/>
<span>and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s whah dey is.</span><br/>
<span>I’s seed ‘m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ‘em no mo’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid</span><br/>
<span>him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch</span><br/>
<span>as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying</span><br/>
<span>there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to</span><br/>
<span>him to see me again, but it warn’t.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but</span><br/>
<span>he warn’t surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard</span><br/>
<span>me yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because he didn’t want nobody to</span><br/>
<span>pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a considable ways</span><br/>
<span>behine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned I could ketch</span><br/>
<span>up wid you on de lan’ ‘dout havin’ to shout at you, but when I see dat</span><br/>
<span>house I begin to go slow.  I ‘uz off too fur to hear what dey say to</span><br/>
<span>you--I wuz ‘fraid o’ de dogs; but when it ‘uz all quiet agin I knowed</span><br/>
<span>you’s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.  Early</span><br/>
<span>in de mawnin’ some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey</span><br/>
<span>tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can’t track me on accounts</span><br/>
<span>o’ de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how</span><br/>
<span>you’s a-gitt’n along.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, ‘twarn’t no use to ‘sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but</span><br/>
<span>we’s all right now.  I ben a-buyin’ pots en pans en vittles, as I got a</span><br/>
<span>chanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’ nights when--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_What_ raft, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Our ole raf’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, she warn’t.  She was tore up a good deal--one en’ of her was; but</span><br/>
<span>dey warn’t no great harm done, on’y our traps was mos’ all los’.  Ef we</span><br/>
<span>hadn’ dive’ so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn’ ben</span><br/>
<span>so dark, en we warn’t so sk’yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin’</span><br/>
<span>is, we’d a seed de raf’.  But it’s jis’ as well we didn’t, ‘kase now</span><br/>
<span>she’s all fixed up agin mos’ as good as new, en we’s got a new lot o’</span><br/>
<span>stuff, in de place o’ what ‘uz los’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er de niggers</span><br/>
<span>foun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en dey hid her in a</span><br/>
<span>crick ‘mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin’ ‘bout which un ‘um</span><br/>
<span>she b’long to de mos’ dat I come to heah ‘bout it pooty soon, so I ups</span><br/>
<span>en settles de trouble by tellin’ ‘um she don’t b’long to none uv um, but</span><br/>
<span>to you en me; en I ast ‘m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman’s</span><br/>
<span>propaty, en git a hid’n for it?  Den I gin ‘m ten cents apiece, en dey</span><br/>
<span>‘uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo’ raf’s ‘ud come along en</span><br/>
<span>make ‘m rich agin. Dey’s mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever</span><br/>
<span>I wants ‘m to do fur me I doan’ have to ast ‘m twice, honey.  Dat Jack’s</span><br/>
<span>a good nigger, en pooty smart.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, he is.  He ain’t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and</span><br/>
<span>he’d show me a lot of water-moccasins.  If anything happens _he_ ain’t</span><br/>
<span>mixed up in it.  He can say he never seen us together, and it ‘ll be the</span><br/>
<span>truth.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I don’t want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I’ll cut it</span><br/>
<span>pretty short.  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and</span><br/>
<span>go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn’t seem to be</span><br/>
<span>anybody stirring.  That warn’t usual.  Next I noticed that Buck was</span><br/>
<span>up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody</span><br/>
<span>around; everything as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  Thinks</span><br/>
<span>I, what does it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s it all about?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says he:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” says I, “I don’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! ‘deed she has.  She run off in de</span><br/>
<span>night some time--nobody don’t know jis’ when; run off to get married</span><br/>
<span>to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey ‘spec.  De</span><br/>
<span>fambly foun’ it out ‘bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo’--en’ I</span><br/>
<span>_tell_ you dey warn’t no time los’.  Sich another hurryin’ up guns</span><br/>
<span>en hosses _you_ never see!  De women folks has gone for to stir up de</span><br/>
<span>relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de</span><br/>
<span>river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ‘fo’ he kin</span><br/>
<span>git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.  I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mighty</span><br/>
<span>rough times.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Buck went off ‘thout waking me up.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I reck’n he _did_!  Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it.</span><br/>
<span>Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ‘lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a</span><br/>
<span>Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un ‘m dah, I reck’n, en you</span><br/>
<span>bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I begin to</span><br/>
<span>hear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the log store and</span><br/>
<span>the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees</span><br/>
<span>and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the</span><br/>
<span>forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There was a</span><br/>
<span>wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I</span><br/>
<span>was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open</span><br/>
<span>place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at</span><br/>
<span>a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the</span><br/>
<span>steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it.  Every time one of them</span><br/>
<span>showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.  The</span><br/>
<span>two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch</span><br/>
<span>both ways.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They started</span><br/>
<span>riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady</span><br/>
<span>bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.  All</span><br/>
<span>the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started</span><br/>
<span>to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the</span><br/>
<span>run.  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.</span><br/>
<span>Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after</span><br/>
<span>them.  They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys had</span><br/>
<span>too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,</span><br/>
<span>and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.</span><br/>
<span>One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about</span><br/>
<span>nineteen years old.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as they was</span><br/>
<span>out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn’t know what</span><br/>
<span>to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.  He was awful</span><br/>
<span>surprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the</span><br/>
<span>men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or</span><br/>
<span>other--wouldn’t be gone long.  I wished I was out of that tree, but I</span><br/>
<span>dasn’t come down.  Buck begun to cry and rip, and ‘lowed that him and</span><br/>
<span>his cousin Joe <i>(that was the other young chap)</i> would make up for this</span><br/>
<span>day yet.  He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two</span><br/>
<span>or three of the enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in</span><br/>
<span>ambush.  Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their</span><br/>
<span>relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I asked him what</span><br/>
<span>was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He said they’d got across</span><br/>
<span>the river and was safe.  I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take</span><br/>
<span>on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I</span><br/>
<span>hain’t ever heard anything like it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had</span><br/>
<span>slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their</span><br/>
<span>horses!  The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they</span><br/>
<span>swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and</span><br/>
<span>singing out, “Kill them, kill them!”  It made me so sick I most fell out</span><br/>
<span>of the tree.  I ain’t a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make</span><br/>
<span>me sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore</span><br/>
<span>that night to see such things.  I ain’t ever going to get shut of</span><br/>
<span>them--lots of times I dream about them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.</span><br/>
<span>Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little</span><br/>
<span>gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the</span><br/>
<span>trouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my</span><br/>
<span>mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I</span><br/>
<span>was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss</span><br/>
<span>Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and</span><br/>
<span>I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way</span><br/>
<span>she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t ever happened.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a</span><br/>
<span>piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and</span><br/>
<span>tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,</span><br/>
<span>and got away as quick as I could.  I cried a little when I was covering</span><br/>
<span>up Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck through</span><br/>
<span>the woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn’t on his island, so I</span><br/>
<span>tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,</span><br/>
<span>red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.  The raft was</span><br/>
<span>gone!  My souls, but I was scared!  I couldn’t get my breath for most</span><br/>
<span>a minute. Then I raised a yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good lan’! is dat you, honey?  Doan’ make no noise.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was Jim’s voice--nothing ever sounded so good before.  I run along the</span><br/>
<span>bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was</span><br/>
<span>so glad to see me.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Laws bless you, chile, I ‘uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin.  Jack’s</span><br/>
<span>been heah; he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no</span><br/>
<span>mo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf er</span><br/>
<span>de crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack</span><br/>
<span>comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.  Lawsy, I’s mighty</span><br/>
<span>glad to git you back again, honey.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right--that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll think</span><br/>
<span>I’ve been killed, and floated down the river--there’s something up there</span><br/>
<span>that ‘ll help them think so--so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but just</span><br/>
<span>shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in</span><br/>
<span>the middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal lantern, and</span><br/>
<span>judged that we was free and safe once more.  I hadn’t had a bite to eat</span><br/>
<span>since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,</span><br/>
<span>and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain’t nothing in the world so good</span><br/>
<span>when it’s cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a</span><br/>
<span>good time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was</span><br/>
<span>Jim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn’t no home like a</span><br/>
<span>raft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a</span><br/>
<span>raft don’t.  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XIX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,</span><br/>
<span>they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put</span><br/>
<span>in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile</span><br/>
<span>and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as</span><br/>
<span>night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always</span><br/>
<span>in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and</span><br/>
<span>willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next</span><br/>
<span>we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool</span><br/>
<span>off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee</span><br/>
<span>deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly</span><br/>
<span>still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs</span><br/>
<span>a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the</span><br/>
<span>water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t’other side; you</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more</span><br/>
<span>paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and</span><br/>
<span>warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots</span><br/>
<span>drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and</span><br/>
<span>long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or</span><br/>
<span>jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and</span><br/>
<span>by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the</span><br/>
<span>streak that there’s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it</span><br/>
<span>and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off</span><br/>
<span>of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a</span><br/>
<span>log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of</span><br/>
<span>the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can</span><br/>
<span>throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and</span><br/>
<span>comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell</span><br/>
<span>on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,</span><br/>
<span>because they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they</span><br/>
<span>do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything</span><br/>
<span>smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off</span><br/>
<span>of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch</span><br/>
<span>the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by</span><br/>
<span>lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and</span><br/>
<span>maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the</span><br/>
<span>other side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only whether she was</span><br/>
<span>a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn’t be</span><br/>
<span>nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next</span><br/>
<span>you’d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it</span><br/>
<span>chopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see the</span><br/>
<span>axe flash and come down--you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go</span><br/>
<span>up again, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the</span><br/>
<span>_k’chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we</span><br/>
<span>would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once</span><br/>
<span>there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating</span><br/>
<span>tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them.  A scow or a</span><br/>
<span>raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and</span><br/>
<span>laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made</span><br/>
<span>you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.</span><br/>
<span>Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the</span><br/>
<span>middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted</span><br/>
<span>her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and</span><br/>
<span>talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,</span><br/>
<span>whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck’s folks made</span><br/>
<span>for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much on</span><br/>
<span>clothes, nohow.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest</span><br/>
<span>time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe</span><br/>
<span>a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water</span><br/>
<span>you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe</span><br/>
<span>you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.</span><br/>
<span>It’s lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled</span><br/>
<span>with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and</span><br/>
<span>discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he</span><br/>
<span>allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would</span><br/>
<span>have took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_</span><br/>
<span>them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t say nothing</span><br/>
<span>against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it</span><br/>
<span>could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them</span><br/>
<span>streak down.  Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove out of the</span><br/>
<span>nest.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the</span><br/>
<span>dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out</span><br/>
<span>of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful</span><br/>
<span>pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and</span><br/>
<span>her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her</span><br/>
<span>waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the</span><br/>
<span>raft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or</span><br/>
<span>three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.</span><br/>
<span>These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant</span><br/>
<span>morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to</span><br/>
<span>the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile</span><br/>
<span>up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get some</span><br/>
<span>berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed</span><br/>
<span>the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as</span><br/>
<span>they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was</span><br/>
<span>after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out</span><br/>
<span>from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung</span><br/>
<span>out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn’t been doing</span><br/>
<span>nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs</span><br/>
<span>a-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you do it.  I don’t hear the dogs and horses yet; you’ve got time</span><br/>
<span>to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you</span><br/>
<span>take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that’ll throw the dogs</span><br/>
<span>off the scent.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,</span><br/>
<span>and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,</span><br/>
<span>shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got</span><br/>
<span>further and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them at</span><br/>
<span>all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the</span><br/>
<span>river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid</span><br/>
<span>in the cottonwoods and was safe.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head</span><br/>
<span>and very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and</span><br/>
<span>a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed</span><br/>
<span>into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one.  He had</span><br/>
<span>an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over</span><br/>
<span>his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.  After</span><br/>
<span>breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out</span><br/>
<span>was that these chaps didn’t know one another.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other chap.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and</span><br/>
<span>it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I</span><br/>
<span>stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act</span><br/>
<span>of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and</span><br/>
<span>you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  So</span><br/>
<span>I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_</span><br/>
<span>you. That’s the whole yarn--what’s yourn?</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’d ben a-running’ a little temperance revival thar ‘bout a week,</span><br/>
<span>and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin’ it</span><br/>
<span>mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin’ as much as five</span><br/>
<span>or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and</span><br/>
<span>business a-growin’ all the time, when somehow or another a little report</span><br/>
<span>got around last night that I had a way of puttin’ in my time with a</span><br/>
<span>private jug on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin’, and told</span><br/>
<span>me the people was getherin’ on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and</span><br/>
<span>they’d be along pretty soon and give me ‘bout half an hour’s start,</span><br/>
<span>and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they’d tar</span><br/>
<span>and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn’t wait for no</span><br/>
<span>breakfast--I warn’t hungry.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might double-team it</span><br/>
<span>together; what do you think?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I ain’t undisposed.  What’s your line--mainly?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;</span><br/>
<span>theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology</span><br/>
<span>when there’s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;</span><br/>
<span>sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that</span><br/>
<span>comes handy, so it ain’t work.  What’s your lay?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.  Layin’ on o’</span><br/>
<span>hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I</span><br/>
<span>k’n tell a fortune pretty good when I’ve got somebody along to find out</span><br/>
<span>the facts for me.  Preachin’s my line, too, and workin’ camp-meetin’s,</span><br/>
<span>and missionaryin’ around.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Alas!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What ‘re you alassin’ about?” says the bald-head.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded</span><br/>
<span>down into such company.”  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye</span><br/>
<span>with a rag.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for you?” says the</span><br/>
<span>baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it’s as good as I deserve; for who</span><br/>
<span>fetched me so low when I was so high?  I did myself.  I don’t blame</span><br/>
<span>_you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don’t blame anybody.  I deserve it</span><br/>
<span>all.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there’s a grave</span><br/>
<span>somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it’s always done, and take</span><br/>
<span>everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take</span><br/>
<span>that. Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken</span><br/>
<span>heart will be at rest.”  He went on a-wiping.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what are you heaving</span><br/>
<span>your pore broken heart at _us_ f’r?  _we_ hain’t done nothing.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, I know you haven’t.  I ain’t blaming you, gentlemen.  I brought</span><br/>
<span>myself down--yes, I did it myself.  It’s right I should suffer--perfectly</span><br/>
<span>right--I don’t make any moan.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Brought you down from whar?  Whar was you brought down from?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--‘tis</span><br/>
<span>no matter.  The secret of my birth--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The secret of your birth!  Do you mean to say--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you,</span><br/>
<span>for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I am a duke!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.</span><br/>
<span>Then the baldhead says:  “No! you can’t mean it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled</span><br/>
<span>to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure</span><br/>
<span>air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father</span><br/>
<span>dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the</span><br/>
<span>titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal</span><br/>
<span>descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and</span><br/>
<span>here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised</span><br/>
<span>by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the</span><br/>
<span>companionship of felons on a raft!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but</span><br/>
<span>he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if we</span><br/>
<span>was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most</span><br/>
<span>anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we</span><br/>
<span>ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,”</span><br/>
<span>or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain</span><br/>
<span>“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and</span><br/>
<span>one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for</span><br/>
<span>him he wanted done.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood</span><br/>
<span>around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis or</span><br/>
<span>some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to</span><br/>
<span>him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn’t have much to say, and</span><br/>
<span>didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on</span><br/>
<span>around that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along</span><br/>
<span>in the afternoon, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, but you</span><br/>
<span>ain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No you ain’t.  You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked down</span><br/>
<span>wrongfully out’n a high place.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Alas!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth.”  And,</span><br/>
<span>by jings, _he_ begins to cry.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold!  What do you mean?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“To the bitter death!”  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,</span><br/>
<span>and says, “That secret of your being:  speak!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You are what?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin’ at this very moment</span><br/>
<span>on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the</span><br/>
<span>Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you’re the late Charlemagne; you must</span><br/>
<span>be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung</span><br/>
<span>these gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes, gentlemen, you</span><br/>
<span>see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,</span><br/>
<span>trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly what to</span><br/>
<span>do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too.</span><br/>
<span>So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort</span><br/>
<span>_him_. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done</span><br/>
<span>with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel</span><br/>
<span>easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his</span><br/>
<span>rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him</span><br/>
<span>“Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t set down</span><br/>
<span>in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,</span><br/>
<span>and doing this and that and t’other for him, and standing up till he</span><br/>
<span>told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he</span><br/>
<span>got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and</span><br/>
<span>didn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,</span><br/>
<span>the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke’s</span><br/>
<span>great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good</span><br/>
<span>deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace</span><br/>
<span>considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the</span><br/>
<span>king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer</span><br/>
<span>raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour?  It ‘ll only</span><br/>
<span>make things oncomfortable.  It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke,</span><br/>
<span>it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king--so what’s the use to worry?</span><br/>
<span>Make the best o’ things the way you find ‘em, says I--that’s my motto.</span><br/>
<span>This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here--plenty grub and an easy</span><br/>
<span>life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le’s all be friends.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took</span><br/>
<span>away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because</span><br/>
<span>it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the</span><br/>
<span>raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody</span><br/>
<span>to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I</span><br/>
<span>never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best way;</span><br/>
<span>then you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no trouble.  If they</span><br/>
<span>wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t no objections, ‘long as</span><br/>
<span>it would keep peace in the family; and it warn’t no use to tell Jim, so</span><br/>
<span>I didn’t tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt</span><br/>
<span>that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them</span><br/>
<span>have their own way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we</span><br/>
<span>covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of</span><br/>
<span>running--was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>No, they allowed he wouldn’t.  I had to account for things some way, so</span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and</span><br/>
<span>they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he ‘lowed</span><br/>
<span>he’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a little</span><br/>
<span>one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was</span><br/>
<span>pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared up there warn’t</span><br/>
<span>nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn’t</span><br/>
<span>enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.</span><br/>
<span>Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched</span><br/>
<span>this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d go down to Orleans on it.</span><br/>
<span>Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of</span><br/>
<span>the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;</span><br/>
<span>Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four</span><br/>
<span>years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or</span><br/>
<span>two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in</span><br/>
<span>skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was</span><br/>
<span>a runaway nigger.  We don’t run daytimes no more now; nights they don’t</span><br/>
<span>bother us.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we</span><br/>
<span>want to.  I’ll think the thing over--I’ll invent a plan that’ll fix it.</span><br/>
<span>We’ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don’t want to go by</span><br/>
<span>that town yonder in daylight--it mightn’t be healthy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat</span><br/>
<span>lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was</span><br/>
<span>beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see</span><br/>
<span>that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see</span><br/>
<span>what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,</span><br/>
<span>which was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a shuck</span><br/>
<span>tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry</span><br/>
<span>shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it</span><br/>
<span>makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would</span><br/>
<span>take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that</span><br/>
<span>a corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on.  Your Grace ‘ll</span><br/>
<span>take the shuck bed yourself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was</span><br/>
<span>going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when</span><br/>
<span>the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of</span><br/>
<span>oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I</span><br/>
<span>submit; ‘tis my fate.  I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear</span><br/>
<span>it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand</span><br/>
<span>well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we</span><br/>
<span>got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of</span><br/>
<span>lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half</span><br/>
<span>a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we</span><br/>
<span>hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rain</span><br/>
<span>and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us</span><br/>
<span>to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke</span><br/>
<span>crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch</span><br/>
<span>below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had a bed,</span><br/>
<span>because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not</span><br/>
<span>by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every</span><br/>
<span>second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half</span><br/>
<span>a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain,</span><br/>
<span>and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!</span><br/>
<span>bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling</span><br/>
<span>and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and</span><br/>
<span>another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,</span><br/>
<span>but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind.  We didn’t have no trouble</span><br/>
<span>about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant</span><br/>
<span>that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or</span><br/>
<span>that and miss them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,</span><br/>
<span>so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always</span><br/>
<span>mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king</span><br/>
<span>and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for</span><br/>
<span>me; so I laid outside--I didn’t mind the rain, because it was warm, and</span><br/>
<span>the waves warn’t running so high now.  About two they come up again,</span><br/>
<span>though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because</span><br/>
<span>he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was</span><br/>
<span>mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a</span><br/>
<span>regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.</span><br/>
<span>He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by</span><br/>
<span>the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed</span><br/>
<span>I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the</span><br/>
<span>day.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him</span><br/>
<span>and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got</span><br/>
<span>tired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as they called</span><br/>
<span>it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of</span><br/>
<span>little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, “The</span><br/>
<span>celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on the</span><br/>
<span>Science of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day of</span><br/>
<span>blank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character at</span><br/>
<span>twenty-five cents apiece.”  The duke said that was _him_.  In another</span><br/>
<span>bill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the</span><br/>
<span>Younger, of Drury Lane, London.”  In other bills he had a lot of other</span><br/>
<span>names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with</span><br/>
<span>a “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on.  By and by he</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,</span><br/>
<span>Royalty?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” says the king.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” says</span><br/>
<span>the duke.  “The first good town we come to we’ll hire a hall and do the</span><br/>
<span>sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.</span><br/>
<span>How does that strike you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you</span><br/>
<span>see, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’, and hain’t ever seen much</span><br/>
<span>of it.  I was too small when pap used to have ‘em at the palace.  Do you</span><br/>
<span>reckon you can learn me?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Easy!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right.  I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh, anyway.  Le’s</span><br/>
<span>commence right away.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and</span><br/>
<span>said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white</span><br/>
<span>whiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever think of that.</span><br/>
<span>Besides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that makes all the</span><br/>
<span>difference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight</span><br/>
<span>before she goes to bed, and she’s got on her night-gown and her ruffled</span><br/>
<span>nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was</span><br/>
<span>meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t’other chap, and a long white</span><br/>
<span>cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was</span><br/>
<span>satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the</span><br/>
<span>most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same</span><br/>
<span>time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the</span><br/>
<span>king and told him to get his part by heart.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and</span><br/>
<span>after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run</span><br/>
<span>in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would</span><br/>
<span>go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,</span><br/>
<span>too, and see if he couldn’t strike something.  We was out of coffee, so</span><br/>
<span>Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, and</span><br/>
<span>perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning</span><br/>
<span>himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t too young or</span><br/>
<span>too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the</span><br/>
<span>woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he’d go and work that</span><br/>
<span>camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;</span><br/>
<span>a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and</span><br/>
<span>printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,</span><br/>
<span>littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of</span><br/>
<span>horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed</span><br/>
<span>his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for</span><br/>
<span>the camp-meeting.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most</span><br/>
<span>awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from</span><br/>
<span>twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched</span><br/>
<span>everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep</span><br/>
<span>off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with</span><br/>
<span>branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of</span><br/>
<span>watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was</span><br/>
<span>bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside</span><br/>
<span>slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into</span><br/>
<span>for legs. They didn’t have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms</span><br/>
<span>to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;</span><br/>
<span>and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the</span><br/>
<span>young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and</span><br/>
<span>some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen</span><br/>
<span>shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks</span><br/>
<span>was courting on the sly.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined</span><br/>
<span>out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,</span><br/>
<span>there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then</span><br/>
<span>he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.  The people woke up</span><br/>
<span>more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some</span><br/>
<span>begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to</span><br/>
<span>preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of</span><br/>
<span>the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front</span><br/>
<span>of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his</span><br/>
<span>words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up</span><br/>
<span>his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and</span><br/>
<span>that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon</span><br/>
<span>it and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And so</span><br/>
<span>he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! <i>(_Amen_!)</i> come,</span><br/>
<span>sick and sore! <i>(_Amen_!)</i> come, lame and halt and blind! <i>(_Amen_!)</i> come,</span><br/>
<span>pore and needy, sunk in shame! <i>(_A-A-Men_!)</i> come, all that’s worn and</span><br/>
<span>soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite</span><br/>
<span>heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse</span><br/>
<span>is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!”</span><br/>
<span><i>(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)</i></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so on.  You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any more, on</span><br/>
<span>account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up everywheres in the</span><br/>
<span>crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners’</span><br/>
<span>bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the</span><br/>
<span>mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and</span><br/>
<span>shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him</span><br/>
<span>over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and</span><br/>
<span>the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He</span><br/>
<span>told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the</span><br/>
<span>Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in</span><br/>
<span>a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to</span><br/>
<span>goodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat</span><br/>
<span>without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that</span><br/>
<span>ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for</span><br/>
<span>the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start</span><br/>
<span>right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest</span><br/>
<span>of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could</span><br/>
<span>do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews</span><br/>
<span>in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there</span><br/>
<span>without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced</span><br/>
<span>a pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t you give me no</span><br/>
<span>credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,</span><br/>
<span>natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher</span><br/>
<span>there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody</span><br/>
<span>sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,</span><br/>
<span>a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_</span><br/>
<span>pass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,</span><br/>
<span>and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being</span><br/>
<span>so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the</span><br/>
<span>prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would</span><br/>
<span>up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he</span><br/>
<span>always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or</span><br/>
<span>six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to</span><br/>
<span>live in their houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said</span><br/>
<span>as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and</span><br/>
<span>besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to</span><br/>
<span>work on the pirates.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had</span><br/>
<span>collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had</span><br/>
<span>fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a</span><br/>
<span>wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,</span><br/>
<span>take it all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in the</span><br/>
<span>missionarying line.  He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens don’t</span><br/>
<span>amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke was thinking _he’d_ been doing pretty well till the king come</span><br/>
<span>to show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.  He had set</span><br/>
<span>up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that</span><br/>
<span>printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he</span><br/>
<span>had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he</span><br/>
<span>said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so</span><br/>
<span>they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took</span><br/>
<span>in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them</span><br/>
<span>paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as</span><br/>
<span>usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the</span><br/>
<span>price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.</span><br/>
<span>He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of</span><br/>
<span>his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,</span><br/>
<span>“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set</span><br/>
<span>up and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it.</span><br/>
<span>Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty</span><br/>
<span>square day’s work for it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t charged</span><br/>
<span>for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with</span><br/>
<span>a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  The</span><br/>
<span>reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said</span><br/>
<span>he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,</span><br/>
<span>last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send</span><br/>
<span>him back he could have the reward and expenses.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we</span><br/>
<span>want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot</span><br/>
<span>with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we</span><br/>
<span>captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,</span><br/>
<span>so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down</span><br/>
<span>to get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,</span><br/>
<span>but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much</span><br/>
<span>like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,</span><br/>
<span>as we say on the boards.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no trouble</span><br/>
<span>about running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles enough that night</span><br/>
<span>to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s work in</span><br/>
<span>the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could</span><br/>
<span>boom right along if we wanted to.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten</span><br/>
<span>o’clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’t</span><br/>
<span>hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ kings on dis</span><br/>
<span>trip?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den.  I doan’ mine one er two kings,</span><br/>
<span>but dat’s enough.  Dis one’s powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much</span><br/>
<span>better.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear</span><br/>
<span>what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and</span><br/>
<span>had so much trouble, he’d forgot it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up.  The</span><br/>
<span>king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after</span><br/>
<span>they’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good</span><br/>
<span>deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,</span><br/>
<span>and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs</span><br/>
<span>dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went</span><br/>
<span>to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty</span><br/>
<span>good him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to</span><br/>
<span>learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him</span><br/>
<span>sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done</span><br/>
<span>it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t bellow out _Romeo_!</span><br/>
<span>that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,</span><br/>
<span>so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet’s a dear sweet mere child of</span><br/>
<span>a girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray like a jackass.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out</span><br/>
<span>of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called</span><br/>
<span>himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around</span><br/>
<span>the raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell</span><br/>
<span>overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all</span><br/>
<span>kinds of adventures they’d had in other times along the river.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After dinner the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so</span><br/>
<span>I guess we’ll add a little more to it.  We want a little something to</span><br/>
<span>answer encores with, anyway.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s onkores, Bilgewater?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke told him, and then says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe; and</span><br/>
<span>you--well, let me see--oh, I’ve got it--you can do Hamlet’s soliloquy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hamlet’s which?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.</span><br/>
<span>Ah, it’s sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the house.  I haven’t got</span><br/>
<span>it in the book--I’ve only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out</span><br/>
<span>from memory.  I’ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call</span><br/>
<span>it back from recollection’s vaults.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible</span><br/>
<span>every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would</span><br/>
<span>squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next</span><br/>
<span>he would sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful</span><br/>
<span>to see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then</span><br/>
<span>he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his</span><br/>
<span>arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;</span><br/>
<span>and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,</span><br/>
<span>all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his</span><br/>
<span>chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.</span><br/>
<span>This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it</span><br/>
<span>to the king:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of</span><br/>
<span>so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come</span><br/>
<span>to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the</span><br/>
<span>innocent sleep, Great nature’s second course, And makes us rather sling</span><br/>
<span>the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.</span><br/>
<span>There’s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I</span><br/>
<span>would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The</span><br/>
<span>oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The law’s delay, and the</span><br/>
<span>quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the</span><br/>
<span>night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But</span><br/>
<span>that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,</span><br/>
<span>Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of</span><br/>
<span>resolution, like the poor cat i’ the adage, Is sicklied o’er with care.</span><br/>
<span>And all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops, With this</span><br/>
<span>regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. ‘Tis a</span><br/>
<span>consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope</span><br/>
<span>not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he</span><br/>
<span>could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when</span><br/>
<span>he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he</span><br/>
<span>would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and</span><br/>
<span>after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a</span><br/>
<span>most uncommon lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fighting</span><br/>
<span>and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,</span><br/>
<span>when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight</span><br/>
<span>of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about</span><br/>
<span>three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was</span><br/>
<span>shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took</span><br/>
<span>the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that</span><br/>
<span>place for our show.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that</span><br/>
<span>afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in</span><br/>
<span>all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave</span><br/>
<span>before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he</span><br/>
<span>hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They</span><br/>
<span>read like this:</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span>Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all</span><br/>
<span>old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted; they</span><br/>
<span>was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of</span><br/>
<span>reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little</span><br/>
<span>gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in</span><br/>
<span>them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up</span><br/>
<span>boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out</span><br/>
<span>tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on</span><br/>
<span>at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that</span><br/>
<span>didn’t generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences</span><br/>
<span>had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in</span><br/>
<span>Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and</span><br/>
<span>people driving them out.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic awnings in</span><br/>
<span>front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.</span><br/>
<span>There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting</span><br/>
<span>on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and</span><br/>
<span>chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery</span><br/>
<span>lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,</span><br/>
<span>but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,</span><br/>
<span>and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and</span><br/>
<span>used considerable many cuss words.  There was as many as one loafer</span><br/>
<span>leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands</span><br/>
<span>in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw</span><br/>
<span>of tobacco or scratch.  What a body was hearing amongst them all the</span><br/>
<span>time was:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gimme a chaw ‘v tobacker, Hank.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got</span><br/>
<span>none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a</span><br/>
<span>chaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all their chawing by borrowing;</span><br/>
<span>they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, I jist this</span><br/>
<span>minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”--which is a lie pretty</span><br/>
<span>much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain’t no</span><br/>
<span>stranger, so he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_You_ give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister’s cat’s</span><br/>
<span>grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready borry’d off’n me,</span><br/>
<span>Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won’t charge</span><br/>
<span>you no back intrust, nuther.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, you did--‘bout six chaws.  You borry’d store tobacker and paid back</span><br/>
<span>nigger-head.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the</span><br/>
<span>natural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it</span><br/>
<span>off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with</span><br/>
<span>their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in</span><br/>
<span>two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it</span><br/>
<span>when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else _but_</span><br/>
<span>mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,</span><br/>
<span>and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.  The hogs loafed and</span><br/>
<span>grunted around everywheres.  You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs</span><br/>
<span>come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,</span><br/>
<span>where folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shut her</span><br/>
<span>eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as</span><br/>
<span>happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer</span><br/>
<span>sing out, “Hi!  _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go,</span><br/>
<span>squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and</span><br/>
<span>three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the</span><br/>
<span>loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun</span><br/>
<span>and look grateful for the noise.  Then they’d settle back again till</span><br/>
<span>there was a dog fight.  There couldn’t anything wake them up all over,</span><br/>
<span>and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be</span><br/>
<span>putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a</span><br/>
<span>tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,</span><br/>
<span>and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people</span><br/>
<span>had moved out of them.  The bank was caved away under one corner of some</span><br/>
<span>others, and that corner was hanging over.  People lived in them yet, but</span><br/>
<span>it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house</span><br/>
<span>caves in at a time.  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep</span><br/>
<span>will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the</span><br/>
<span>river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,</span><br/>
<span>and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the</span><br/>
<span>wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.</span><br/>
<span>Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them</span><br/>
<span>in the wagons.  There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I</span><br/>
<span>seen three fights.  By and by somebody sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly</span><br/>
<span>drunk; here he comes, boys!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out</span><br/>
<span>of Boggs.  One of them says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he’d a-chawed up all</span><br/>
<span>the men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he’d have</span><br/>
<span>considerable ruputation now.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs ‘d threaten me, ‘cuz then I’d know</span><br/>
<span>I warn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an</span><br/>
<span>Injun, and singing out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cler the track, thar.  I’m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is</span><br/>
<span>a-gwyne to raise.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year</span><br/>
<span>old, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at</span><br/>
<span>him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to them and</span><br/>
<span>lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait now because</span><br/>
<span>he’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meat</span><br/>
<span>first, and spoon vittles to top off on.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He see me, and rode up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Whar’d you come f’m, boy?  You prepared to die?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’s</span><br/>
<span>drunk.  He’s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,</span><br/>
<span>drunk nor sober.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down</span><br/>
<span>so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled.</span><br/>
<span>You’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m a-gwyne to have you, too!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue</span><br/>
<span>to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and</span><br/>
<span>going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a</span><br/>
<span>heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and</span><br/>
<span>the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs,</span><br/>
<span>mighty ca’m and slow--he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock.  Till one</span><br/>
<span>o’clock, mind--no longer.  If you open your mouth against me only once</span><br/>
<span>after that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody</span><br/>
<span>stirred, and there warn’t no more laughing.  Boggs rode off</span><br/>
<span>blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;</span><br/>
<span>and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping</span><br/>
<span>it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,</span><br/>
<span>but he wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about fifteen</span><br/>
<span>minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn’t</span><br/>
<span>do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down</span><br/>
<span>in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down</span><br/>
<span>the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get</span><br/>
<span>a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they</span><br/>
<span>could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn’t no use--up the street</span><br/>
<span>he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by</span><br/>
<span>somebody says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’ll listen</span><br/>
<span>to her.  If anybody can persuade him, she can.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and stopped.</span><br/>
<span>In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his</span><br/>
<span>horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with</span><br/>
<span>a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.</span><br/>
<span>He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t hanging back any, but was</span><br/>
<span>doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Boggs!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel</span><br/>
<span>Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a</span><br/>
<span>pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with</span><br/>
<span>the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young</span><br/>
<span>girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned</span><br/>
<span>round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men</span><br/>
<span>jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to</span><br/>
<span>a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,</span><br/>
<span>“O Lord, don’t shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,</span><br/>
<span>clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards</span><br/>
<span>on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young</span><br/>
<span>girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her</span><br/>
<span>father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed him, he’s killed him!”  The</span><br/>
<span>crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with</span><br/>
<span>their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to</span><br/>
<span>shove them back and shouting, “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned</span><br/>
<span>around on his heels and walked off.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just</span><br/>
<span>the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good</span><br/>
<span>place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They</span><br/>
<span>laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened</span><br/>
<span>another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt</span><br/>
<span>first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a</span><br/>
<span>dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his</span><br/>
<span>breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that</span><br/>
<span>he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from</span><br/>
<span>him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and</span><br/>
<span>very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and</span><br/>
<span>pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people</span><br/>
<span>that had the places wouldn’t give them up, and folks behind them was</span><br/>
<span>saying all the time, “Say, now, you’ve looked enough, you fellows;</span><br/>
<span>‘tain’t right and ‘tain’t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and</span><br/>
<span>never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as</span><br/>
<span>you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe</span><br/>
<span>there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was</span><br/>
<span>excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,</span><br/>
<span>and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,</span><br/>
<span>stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long</span><br/>
<span>hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a</span><br/>
<span>crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs</span><br/>
<span>stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from</span><br/>
<span>one place to t’other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their</span><br/>
<span>heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their</span><br/>
<span>hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with</span><br/>
<span>his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had</span><br/>
<span>stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung</span><br/>
<span>out, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says</span><br/>
<span>“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on</span><br/>
<span>his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;</span><br/>
<span>said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a</span><br/>
<span>dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a</span><br/>
<span>minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and</span><br/>
<span>snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like</span><br/>
<span>Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped</span><br/>
<span>to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the</span><br/>
<span>mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along</span><br/>
<span>the road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in every</span><br/>
<span>tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the</span><br/>
<span>mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of</span><br/>
<span>reach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared</span><br/>
<span>most to death.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they could</span><br/>
<span>jam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the noise.  It</span><br/>
<span>was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear</span><br/>
<span>down the fence!”  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and</span><br/>
<span>smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to</span><br/>
<span>roll in like a wave.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,</span><br/>
<span>with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly</span><br/>
<span>ca’m and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the</span><br/>
<span>wave sucked back.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The</span><br/>
<span>stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow</span><br/>
<span>along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to</span><br/>
<span>out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked</span><br/>
<span>sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant</span><br/>
<span>kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread</span><br/>
<span>that’s got sand in it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he says, slow and scornful:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It’s amusing.  The idea of you</span><br/>
<span>thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you’re brave</span><br/>
<span>enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along</span><br/>
<span>here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a</span><br/>
<span>_man_?  Why, a _man’s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as</span><br/>
<span>long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the</span><br/>
<span>South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.</span><br/>
<span>The average man’s a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him</span><br/>
<span>that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.</span><br/>
<span>In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men</span><br/>
<span>in the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a</span><br/>
<span>brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other</span><br/>
<span>people--whereas you’re just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don’t your</span><br/>
<span>juries hang murderers?  Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will</span><br/>
<span>shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it’s just what they _would_ do.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a</span><br/>
<span>hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake</span><br/>
<span>is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the</span><br/>
<span>other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You</span><br/>
<span>brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn’t had him</span><br/>
<span>to start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You didn’t want to come.  The average man don’t like trouble and</span><br/>
<span>danger. _You_ don’t like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a</span><br/>
<span>man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re</span><br/>
<span>afraid to back down--afraid you’ll be found out to be what you</span><br/>
<span>are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that</span><br/>
<span>half-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big</span><br/>
<span>things you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s</span><br/>
<span>what an army is--a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in</span><br/>
<span>them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their</span><br/>
<span>officers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_</span><br/>
<span>pitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and</span><br/>
<span>go home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching’s going to be done it</span><br/>
<span>will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll</span><br/>
<span>bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your</span><br/>
<span>half-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking</span><br/>
<span>it when he says this.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing</span><br/>
<span>off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking</span><br/>
<span>tolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman</span><br/>
<span>went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold</span><br/>
<span>piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because</span><br/>
<span>there ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from</span><br/>
<span>home and amongst strangers that way.  You can’t be too careful.  I ain’t</span><br/>
<span>opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t no other way, but</span><br/>
<span>there ain’t no use in _wasting_ it on them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was</span><br/>
<span>when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side</span><br/>
<span>by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes</span><br/>
<span>nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and</span><br/>
<span>comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a</span><br/>
<span>lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang</span><br/>
<span>of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of</span><br/>
<span>dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;</span><br/>
<span>I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up</span><br/>
<span>and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and</span><br/>
<span>graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their</span><br/>
<span>heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and</span><br/>
<span>every lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,</span><br/>
<span>and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one</span><br/>
<span>foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and</span><br/>
<span>more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking</span><br/>
<span>his whip and shouting “Hi!--hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind</span><br/>
<span>him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her</span><br/>
<span>knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how</span><br/>
<span>the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the</span><br/>
<span>other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I</span><br/>
<span>ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and</span><br/>
<span>went just about wild.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and</span><br/>
<span>all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The</span><br/>
<span>ringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick</span><br/>
<span>as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever</span><br/>
<span>_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year.</span><br/>
<span>And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to</span><br/>
<span>ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued</span><br/>
<span>and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show</span><br/>
<span>come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make</span><br/>
<span>fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that</span><br/>
<span>stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the</span><br/>
<span>benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him</span><br/>
<span>out!” and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster</span><br/>
<span>he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no</span><br/>
<span>disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more</span><br/>
<span>trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.</span><br/>
<span>So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute</span><br/>
<span>he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,</span><br/>
<span>with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the</span><br/>
<span>drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every</span><br/>
<span>jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing</span><br/>
<span>till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men</span><br/>
<span>could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,</span><br/>
<span>round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging</span><br/>
<span>to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,</span><br/>
<span>and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy.  It</span><br/>
<span>warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.</span><br/>
<span>But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,</span><br/>
<span>a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and</span><br/>
<span>dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire</span><br/>
<span>too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable</span><br/>
<span>as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his</span><br/>
<span>clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up</span><br/>
<span>the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he</span><br/>
<span>was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you</span><br/>
<span>ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly</span><br/>
<span>hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to</span><br/>
<span>the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and</span><br/>
<span>astonishment.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the</span><br/>
<span>sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own</span><br/>
<span>men!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on</span><br/>
<span>to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>a been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don’t</span><br/>
<span>know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I</span><br/>
<span>never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and</span><br/>
<span>wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn’t only about twelve</span><br/>
<span>people there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the</span><br/>
<span>time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before</span><br/>
<span>the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these</span><br/>
<span>Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted</span><br/>
<span>was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he</span><br/>
<span>reckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got</span><br/>
<span>some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off</span><br/>
<span>some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and</span><br/>
<span>a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house</span><br/>
<span>was jam full of men in no time.  When the place couldn’t hold no more,</span><br/>
<span>the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on</span><br/>
<span>to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,</span><br/>
<span>and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one</span><br/>
<span>that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about</span><br/>
<span>Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;</span><br/>
<span>and at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high enough, he</span><br/>
<span>rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing</span><br/>
<span>out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,</span><br/>
<span>ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a</span><br/>
<span>rainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,</span><br/>
<span>but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and</span><br/>
<span>when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they</span><br/>
<span>roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done</span><br/>
<span>it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it</span><br/>
<span>would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says</span><br/>
<span>the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of</span><br/>
<span>pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it</span><br/>
<span>in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has</span><br/>
<span>succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply</span><br/>
<span>obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come</span><br/>
<span>and see it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Twenty people sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What, is it over?  Is that _all_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody sings</span><br/>
<span>out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them</span><br/>
<span>tragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen.”  They stopped to listen.  “We are</span><br/>
<span>sold--mighty badly sold.  But we don’t want to be the laughing stock of</span><br/>
<span>this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long</span><br/>
<span>as we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk</span><br/>
<span>this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we’ll all be in the</span><br/>
<span>same boat.  Ain’t that sensible?” <i>(“You bet it is!--the jedge is right!”</span><br/>
<span>everybody sings out.)</i> “All right, then--not a word about any sell.  Go</span><br/>
<span>along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next day you couldn’t hear nothing around that town but how splendid</span><br/>
<span>that show was.  House was jammed again that night, and we sold this</span><br/>
<span>crowd the same way.  When me and the king and the duke got home to the</span><br/>
<span>raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim</span><br/>
<span>and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and</span><br/>
<span>fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn’t new-comers</span><br/>
<span>this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.  I</span><br/>
<span>stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had</span><br/>
<span>his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs</span><br/>
<span>by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the</span><br/>
<span>signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four</span><br/>
<span>of them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various</span><br/>
<span>for me; I couldn’t stand it.  Well, when the place couldn’t hold no more</span><br/>
<span>people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door</span><br/>
<span>for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after</span><br/>
<span>him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the</span><br/>
<span>raft like the dickens was after you!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the same time,</span><br/>
<span>and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and</span><br/>
<span>still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a</span><br/>
<span>word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the</span><br/>
<span>audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under</span><br/>
<span>the wigwam, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time, duke?”  He hadn’t been</span><br/>
<span>up-town at all.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.</span><br/>
<span>Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly</span><br/>
<span>laughed their bones loose over the way they’d served them people.  The</span><br/>
<span>duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum and let</span><br/>
<span>the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for us the</span><br/>
<span>third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.  Well, it _is_ their</span><br/>
<span>turn, and I’d give something to know how much they’d take for it.  I</span><br/>
<span>_would_ just like to know how they’re putting in their opportunity.</span><br/>
<span>They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty</span><br/>
<span>provisions.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that</span><br/>
<span>three nights.  I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that</span><br/>
<span>before.  By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” I says, “it don’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why don’t it, Huck?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed.  I reckon they’re all</span><br/>
<span>alike.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat’s jist what</span><br/>
<span>dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as</span><br/>
<span>fur as I can make out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is dat so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You read about them once--you’ll see.  Look at Henry the Eight; this ‘n</span><br/>
<span>‘s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.  And look at Charles Second,</span><br/>
<span>and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward</span><br/>
<span>Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon</span><br/>
<span>heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.  My,</span><br/>
<span>you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He _was_ a</span><br/>
<span>blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head</span><br/>
<span>next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was</span><br/>
<span>ordering up eggs.  ‘Fetch up Nell Gwynn,’ he says.  They fetch her up.</span><br/>
<span>Next morning, ‘Chop off her head!’  And they chop it off.  ‘Fetch up</span><br/>
<span>Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop off her</span><br/>
<span>head’--and they chop it off.  ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.’  Fair Rosamun</span><br/>
<span>answers the bell.  Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.’  And he made every</span><br/>
<span>one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had</span><br/>
<span>hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a</span><br/>
<span>book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the</span><br/>
<span>case.  You don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip</span><br/>
<span>of ourn is one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history.  Well, Henry he</span><br/>
<span>takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How</span><br/>
<span>does he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show?  No.  All of a</span><br/>
<span>sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks</span><br/>
<span>out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.  That was</span><br/>
<span>_his_ style--he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his</span><br/>
<span>father, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show</span><br/>
<span>up?  No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.  S’pose people</span><br/>
<span>left money laying around where he was--what did he do?  He collared it.</span><br/>
<span>S’pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set</span><br/>
<span>down there and see that he done it--what did he do?  He always done the</span><br/>
<span>other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth--what then?  If he didn’t shut it</span><br/>
<span>up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every time.  That’s the kind of a bug</span><br/>
<span>Henry was; and if we’d a had him along ‘stead of our kings he’d a fooled</span><br/>
<span>that town a heap worse than ourn done.  I don’t say that ourn is lambs,</span><br/>
<span>because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they</span><br/>
<span>ain’t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,</span><br/>
<span>and you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they’re a mighty</span><br/>
<span>ornery lot. It’s the way they’re raised.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, they all do, Jim.  We can’t help the way a king smells; history</span><br/>
<span>don’t tell no way.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now de duke, he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, a duke’s different.  But not very different.  This one’s</span><br/>
<span>a middling hard lot for a duke.  When he’s drunk there ain’t no</span><br/>
<span>near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, anyways, I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um, Huck.  Dese is all I</span><br/>
<span>kin stan’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we’ve got them on our hands, and we</span><br/>
<span>got to remember what they are, and make allowances.  Sometimes I wish we</span><br/>
<span>could hear of a country that’s out of kings.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>What was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes?  It</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said:  you</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t tell them from the real kind.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went to sleep, and Jim didn’t call me when it was my turn.  He often</span><br/>
<span>done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with</span><br/>
<span>his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t take notice nor let on.  I knowed what it was about.  He was</span><br/>
<span>thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low</span><br/>
<span>and homesick; because he hadn’t ever been away from home before in his</span><br/>
<span>life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white</span><br/>
<span>folks does for their’n.  It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so.</span><br/>
<span>He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I</span><br/>
<span>was asleep, and saying, “Po’ little ‘Lizabeth! po’ little Johnny! it’s</span><br/>
<span>mighty hard; I spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!”  He</span><br/>
<span>was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young</span><br/>
<span>ones; and by and by he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What makes me feel so bad dis time ‘uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder</span><br/>
<span>on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time</span><br/>
<span>I treat my little ‘Lizabeth so ornery.  She warn’t on’y ‘bout fo’ year</span><br/>
<span>ole, en she tuck de sk’yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but</span><br/>
<span>she got well, en one day she was a-stannin’ aroun’, en I says to her, I</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Shet de do’.’</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“She never done it; jis’ stood dah, kiner smilin’ up at me.  It make me</span><br/>
<span>mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Doan’ you hear me?  Shet de do’!’</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin’ up.  I was a-bilin’!  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘I lay I _make_ you mine!’</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“En wid dat I fetch’ her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin’.</span><br/>
<span>Den I went into de yuther room, en ‘uz gone ‘bout ten minutes; en when</span><br/>
<span>I come back dah was dat do’ a-stannin’ open _yit_, en dat chile stannin’</span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXIV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in</span><br/>
<span>the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the</span><br/>
<span>duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim</span><br/>
<span>he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few</span><br/>
<span>hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to</span><br/>
<span>lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him</span><br/>
<span>all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all</span><br/>
<span>by himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway</span><br/>
<span>nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay</span><br/>
<span>roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed</span><br/>
<span>Jim up in King Lear’s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a</span><br/>
<span>white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint</span><br/>
<span>and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,</span><br/>
<span>dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days.  Blamed if</span><br/>
<span>he warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took</span><br/>
<span>and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five</span><br/>
<span>foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight</span><br/>
<span>better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all</span><br/>
<span>over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself</span><br/>
<span>free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop</span><br/>
<span>out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like</span><br/>
<span>a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.</span><br/>
<span>Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn’t only look like he was</span><br/>
<span>dead, he looked considerable more than that.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was</span><br/>
<span>so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe</span><br/>
<span>the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn’t hit no</span><br/>
<span>project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’d</span><br/>
<span>lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t put up</span><br/>
<span>something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop</span><br/>
<span>over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence</span><br/>
<span>to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all</span><br/>
<span>bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n</span><br/>
<span>on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king’s</span><br/>
<span>duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never</span><br/>
<span>knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked</span><br/>
<span>like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off</span><br/>
<span>his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand</span><br/>
<span>and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark,</span><br/>
<span>and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I</span><br/>
<span>got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away</span><br/>
<span>up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple</span><br/>
<span>of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.</span><br/>
<span>Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,</span><br/>
<span>Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.</span><br/>
<span>I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went</span><br/>
<span>scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to</span><br/>
<span>a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the</span><br/>
<span>sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a</span><br/>
<span>couple of big carpet-bags by him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher’ you bound</span><br/>
<span>for, young man?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Git aboard,” says the king.  “Hold on a minute, my servant ‘ll he’p you</span><br/>
<span>with them bags.  Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”--meaning me,</span><br/>
<span>I see.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was</span><br/>
<span>mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.</span><br/>
<span>He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come</span><br/>
<span>down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he</span><br/>
<span>was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The</span><br/>
<span>young fellow says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he</span><br/>
<span>come mighty near getting here in time.’  But then I says again, ‘No, I</span><br/>
<span>reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’  You</span><br/>
<span>_ain’t_ him, are you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, my name’s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander</span><br/>
<span>Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants.</span><br/>
<span>But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving</span><br/>
<span>in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it--which I hope he</span><br/>
<span>hasn’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all</span><br/>
<span>right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn’t</span><br/>
<span>mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything</span><br/>
<span>in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing</span><br/>
<span>else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys</span><br/>
<span>together--and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all--that’s the deef</span><br/>
<span>and dumb one--William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and</span><br/>
<span>George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married</span><br/>
<span>brother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William’s the</span><br/>
<span>only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here</span><br/>
<span>in time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did anybody send ‘em word?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter</span><br/>
<span>said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this</span><br/>
<span>time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to</span><br/>
<span>be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he</span><br/>
<span>was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem</span><br/>
<span>to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and</span><br/>
<span>William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can’t</span><br/>
<span>bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d</span><br/>
<span>told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the</span><br/>
<span>property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right--for George</span><br/>
<span>didn’t leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put</span><br/>
<span>a pen to.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come?  Wher’ does he live?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn’t ever been in</span><br/>
<span>this country.  He hasn’t had any too much time--and besides he mightn’t a</span><br/>
<span>got the letter at all, you know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.</span><br/>
<span>You going to Orleans, you say?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it.  I’m going in a ship, next</span><br/>
<span>Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a pretty long journey.  But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.</span><br/>
<span>Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about</span><br/>
<span>fourteen--that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a</span><br/>
<span>hare-lip.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they</span><br/>
<span>ain’t going to let them come to no harm.  There’s Hobson, the Babtis’</span><br/>
<span>preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,</span><br/>
<span>and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the</span><br/>
<span>widow Bartley, and--well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones</span><br/>
<span>that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when</span><br/>
<span>he wrote home; so Harvey ‘ll know where to look for friends when he gets</span><br/>
<span>here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied</span><br/>
<span>that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and</span><br/>
<span>everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about</span><br/>
<span>Peter’s business--which was a tanner; and about George’s--which was a</span><br/>
<span>carpenter; and about Harvey’s--which was a dissentering minister; and so</span><br/>
<span>on, and so on.  Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop</span><br/>
<span>there.  When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat</span><br/>
<span>will, but this is a St. Louis one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Was Peter Wilks well off?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he</span><br/>
<span>left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“When did you say he died?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, ‘bout the middle of the day.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or</span><br/>
<span>another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, sir, it’s the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she</span><br/>
<span>got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost</span><br/>
<span>my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up</span><br/>
<span>another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new</span><br/>
<span>carpet-bags.  And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there and</span><br/>
<span>git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When</span><br/>
<span>I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a</span><br/>
<span>log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had</span><br/>
<span>said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he</span><br/>
<span>tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for</span><br/>
<span>a slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t a-going to try to; but he</span><br/>
<span>really done it pretty good.  Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef</span><br/>
<span>and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a</span><br/>
<span>steamboat.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,</span><br/>
<span>but they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there</span><br/>
<span>was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went</span><br/>
<span>aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted</span><br/>
<span>to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and</span><br/>
<span>said they wouldn’t land us.  But the king was ca’m.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and</span><br/>
<span>put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ‘em, can’t it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the</span><br/>
<span>village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when</span><br/>
<span>they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they</span><br/>
<span>give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,</span><br/>
<span>“What d’ I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_</span><br/>
<span>live yesterday evening.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up</span><br/>
<span>against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his</span><br/>
<span>back, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,</span><br/>
<span>it’s too, too hard!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to</span><br/>
<span>the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and</span><br/>
<span>bust out a-crying.  If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,</span><br/>
<span>that ever I struck.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all</span><br/>
<span>sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill</span><br/>
<span>for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about</span><br/>
<span>his brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on</span><br/>
<span>his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner</span><br/>
<span>like they’d lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything</span><br/>
<span>like it, I’m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human</span><br/>
<span>race.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people</span><br/>
<span>tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on</span><br/>
<span>their coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,</span><br/>
<span>and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.  The windows and</span><br/>
<span>dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is it _them_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You bet it is.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the</span><br/>
<span>three girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but</span><br/>
<span>that don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her</span><br/>
<span>face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles</span><br/>
<span>was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for</span><br/>
<span>them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!</span><br/>
<span>Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again</span><br/>
<span>at last and have such good times.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he</span><br/>
<span>looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so</span><br/>
<span>then him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder, and</span><br/>
<span>t’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody</span><br/>
<span>dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,</span><br/>
<span>people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off and drooping</span><br/>
<span>their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there</span><br/>
<span>they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then</span><br/>
<span>they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and</span><br/>
<span>then they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hung their chins</span><br/>
<span>over each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,</span><br/>
<span>I never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody</span><br/>
<span>was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything</span><br/>
<span>like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t’other on</span><br/>
<span>t’other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the</span><br/>
<span>coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it come</span><br/>
<span>to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and</span><br/>
<span>everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,</span><br/>
<span>too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a</span><br/>
<span>word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand</span><br/>
<span>on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running</span><br/>
<span>down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give</span><br/>
<span>the next woman a show.  I never see anything so disgusting.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and</span><br/>
<span>works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and</span><br/>
<span>flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother</span><br/>
<span>to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long</span><br/>
<span>journey of four thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and</span><br/>
<span>sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he</span><br/>
<span>thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because out</span><br/>
<span>of their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and all that</span><br/>
<span>kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers</span><br/>
<span>out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying</span><br/>
<span>fit to bust.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the</span><br/>
<span>crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their</span><br/>
<span>might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church</span><br/>
<span>letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and</span><br/>
<span>hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and</span><br/>
<span>bully.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his</span><br/>
<span>nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the</span><br/>
<span>family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up</span><br/>
<span>with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying</span><br/>
<span>yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that</span><br/>
<span>was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will</span><br/>
<span>name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon</span><br/>
<span>Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and</span><br/>
<span>Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting</span><br/>
<span>together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’other</span><br/>
<span>world, and the preacher was pinting him right.  Lawyer Bell was away up</span><br/>
<span>to Louisville on business.  But the rest was on hand, and so they all</span><br/>
<span>come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;</span><br/>
<span>and then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but just</span><br/>
<span>kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst</span><br/>
<span>he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo”</span><br/>
<span>all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty</span><br/>
<span>much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts</span><br/>
<span>of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to</span><br/>
<span>George’s family, or to Peter.  And he always let on that Peter wrote him</span><br/>
<span>the things; but that was a lie:  he got every blessed one of them out of</span><br/>
<span>that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the</span><br/>
<span>king he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the dwelling-house</span><br/>
<span>and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard</span><br/>
<span><i>(which was doing a good business)</i>, along with some other houses and</span><br/>
<span>land <i>(worth about seven thousand)</i>, and three thousand dollars in gold</span><br/>
<span>to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down</span><br/>
<span>cellar.  So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have</span><br/>
<span>everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.</span><br/>
<span>We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag</span><br/>
<span>they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them</span><br/>
<span>yaller-boys.  My, the way the king’s eyes did shine!  He slaps the duke</span><br/>
<span>on the shoulder and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, _this_ ain’t bully nor noth’n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,</span><br/>
<span>_bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don’t_ it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them</span><br/>
<span>through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the</span><br/>
<span>king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich dead man and</span><br/>
<span>representatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the line for you and</span><br/>
<span>me, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust’n to Providence.  It’s the best</span><br/>
<span>way, in the long run.  I’ve tried ‘em all, and ther’ ain’t no better</span><br/>
<span>way.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on</span><br/>
<span>trust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and it comes out</span><br/>
<span>four hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the king:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen</span><br/>
<span>dollars?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.  Then</span><br/>
<span>the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon</span><br/>
<span>that’s the way of it.  The best way’s to let it go, and keep still about</span><br/>
<span>it.  We can spare it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.  I don’t k’yer noth’n ‘bout</span><br/>
<span>that--it’s the _count_ I’m thinkin’ about.  We want to be awful square</span><br/>
<span>and open and above-board here, you know.  We want to lug this h-yer</span><br/>
<span>money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther’ ain’t noth’n</span><br/>
<span>suspicious.  But when the dead man says ther’s six thous’n dollars, you</span><br/>
<span>know, we don’t want to--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on,” says the duke.  “Le’s make up the deffisit,” and he begun to</span><br/>
<span>haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin’ clever</span><br/>
<span>head on you,” says the king.  “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’</span><br/>
<span>us out agin,” and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them</span><br/>
<span>up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea.  Le’s go up stairs and count</span><br/>
<span>this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It’s the most dazzling idea ‘at ever a</span><br/>
<span>man struck.  You have cert’nly got the most astonishin’ head I ever see.</span><br/>
<span>Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ ain’t no mistake ‘bout it.  Let ‘em</span><br/>
<span>fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this ‘ll lay ‘em out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king</span><br/>
<span>he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty</span><br/>
<span>elegant little piles.  Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their</span><br/>
<span>chops.  Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin</span><br/>
<span>to swell himself up for another speech.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by</span><br/>
<span>them that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He has done generous by</span><br/>
<span>these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that’s left</span><br/>
<span>fatherless and motherless.  Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he</span><br/>
<span>would a done _more_ generous by ‘em if he hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’</span><br/>
<span>his dear William and me.  Now, _wouldn’t_ he?  Ther’ ain’t no question</span><br/>
<span>‘bout it in _my_ mind.  Well, then, what kind o’ brothers would it be</span><br/>
<span>that ‘d stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o’ uncles would</span><br/>
<span>it be that ‘d rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these ‘at he loved</span><br/>
<span>so at sech a time?  If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I’ll</span><br/>
<span>jest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to</span><br/>
<span>the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and</span><br/>
<span>leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his</span><br/>
<span>meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,</span><br/>
<span>and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.  Then the king says,</span><br/>
<span>“I knowed it; I reckon _that ‘ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels</span><br/>
<span>about it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it</span><br/>
<span>_all_.  It’s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the</span><br/>
<span>duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.  And</span><br/>
<span>everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the</span><br/>
<span>hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased</span><br/>
<span>again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and</span><br/>
<span>before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,</span><br/>
<span>and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody</span><br/>
<span>saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was</span><br/>
<span>all busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he’d</span><br/>
<span>started in on--</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“--they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased.  That’s why they’re</span><br/>
<span>invited here this evenin’; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;</span><br/>
<span>for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that</span><br/>
<span>his funeral orgies sh’d be public.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and</span><br/>
<span>every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke</span><br/>
<span>he couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,</span><br/>
<span>“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and</span><br/>
<span>reaching it over people’s heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts</span><br/>
<span>it in his pocket, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart’s_ aluz right.  Asks me</span><br/>
<span>to invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make ‘em all</span><br/>
<span>welcome.  But he needn’t a worried--it was jest what I was at.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in his</span><br/>
<span>funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.  And</span><br/>
<span>when he done it the third time he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it</span><br/>
<span>ain’t--obsequies bein’ the common term--but because orgies is the right</span><br/>
<span>term. Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now--it’s gone out.  We</span><br/>
<span>say orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing</span><br/>
<span>you’re after more exact.  It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek</span><br/>
<span>_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover</span><br/>
<span>up; hence in_ter._  So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public</span><br/>
<span>funeral.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was the _worst_ I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed</span><br/>
<span>right in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody says, “Why,</span><br/>
<span>_doctor_!” and Abner Shackleford says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news?  This is Harvey Wilks.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician?  I--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor.  “_You_ talk like an</span><br/>
<span>Englishman, _don’t_ you?  It’s the worst imitation I ever heard.  _You_</span><br/>
<span>Peter Wilks’s brother!  You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor and tried to</span><br/>
<span>quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey ‘d</span><br/>
<span>showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,</span><br/>
<span>and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt</span><br/>
<span>Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings, and all that.  But it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended</span><br/>
<span>to be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no better than what</span><br/>
<span>he did was a fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king</span><br/>
<span>and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.  He</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I warn you as a</span><br/>
<span>friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of</span><br/>
<span>harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing</span><br/>
<span>to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,</span><br/>
<span>as he calls it.  He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here</span><br/>
<span>with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and</span><br/>
<span>you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these</span><br/>
<span>foolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks, you</span><br/>
<span>know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.  Now listen</span><br/>
<span>to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it.  Will you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!  She</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Here_ is my answer.”  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the</span><br/>
<span>king’s hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for</span><br/>
<span>me and my sisters any way you want to, and don’t give us no receipt for</span><br/>
<span>it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the</span><br/>
<span>hare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped their hands and</span><br/>
<span>stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his</span><br/>
<span>head and smiled proud.  The doctor says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.  But I warn you all that a</span><br/>
<span>time ‘s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think of this</span><br/>
<span>day.” And away he went.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we’ll try and</span><br/>
<span>get ‘em to send for you;” which made them all laugh, and they said it</span><br/>
<span>was a prime good hit.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXVI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off</span><br/>
<span>for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for</span><br/>
<span>Uncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was</span><br/>
<span>a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and</span><br/>
<span>sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.</span><br/>
<span>The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was</span><br/>
<span>plain but nice.  She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other traps</span><br/>
<span>took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he said</span><br/>
<span>they warn’t.  The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was</span><br/>
<span>a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.  There was an</span><br/>
<span>old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts</span><br/>
<span>of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room</span><br/>
<span>with.  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for</span><br/>
<span>these fixings, and so don’t disturb them.  The duke’s room was pretty</span><br/>
<span>small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,</span><br/>
<span>and I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on them,</span><br/>
<span>and the niggers waited on the rest.  Mary Jane she set at the head of</span><br/>
<span>the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits</span><br/>
<span>was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried</span><br/>
<span>chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to</span><br/>
<span>force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,</span><br/>
<span>and said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and</span><br/>
<span>“Where, for the land’s sake, _did_ you get these amaz’n pickles?” and</span><br/>
<span>all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a</span><br/>
<span>supper, you know.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen</span><br/>
<span>off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up</span><br/>
<span>the things.  The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest</span><br/>
<span>if I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.  She says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did you ever see the king?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who?  William Fourth?  Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.”  I</span><br/>
<span>knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.  So when I says he</span><br/>
<span>goes to our church, she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What--regular?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes--regular.  His pew’s right over opposite ourn--on t’other side the</span><br/>
<span>pulpit.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I thought he lived in London?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, he does.  Where _would_ he live?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see I was up a stump.  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken</span><br/>
<span>bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.  Then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield.  That’s</span><br/>
<span>only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, who said it was?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, you did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I _didn’t_ nuther.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You did!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I didn’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I never said nothing of the kind.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, what _did_ you say, then?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that’s what I said.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the</span><br/>
<span>sea?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, no.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea</span><br/>
<span>bath.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How does he get it, then?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels.  There</span><br/>
<span>in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his water</span><br/>
<span>hot.  They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.</span><br/>
<span>They haven’t got no conveniences for it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, I see, now.  You might a said that in the first place and saved</span><br/>
<span>time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was</span><br/>
<span>comfortable and glad.  Next, she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Do you go to church, too?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes--regular.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Where do you set?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, in our pew.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Whose_ pew?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey’s.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“His’n?  What does _he_ want with a pew?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Wants it to set in.  What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher.  I see I was up a stump again, so I</span><br/>
<span>played another chicken bone and got another think.  Then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, what do they want with more?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What!--to preach before a king?  I never did see such a girl as you.</span><br/>
<span>They don’t have no less than seventeen.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Seventeen!  My land!  Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that,</span><br/>
<span>not if I _never_ got to glory.  It must take ‘em a week.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks, they don’t _all_ of ‘em preach the same day--only _one_ of ‘em.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what does the rest of ‘em do?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, nothing much.  Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or</span><br/>
<span>another.  But mainly they don’t do nothing.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what are they _for_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, they’re for _style_.  Don’t you know nothing?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I don’t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.  How is</span><br/>
<span>servants treated in England?  Do they treat ‘em better ‘n we treat our</span><br/>
<span>niggers?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_No_!  A servant ain’t nobody there.  They treat them worse than dogs.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t they give ‘em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’s</span><br/>
<span>week, and Fourth of July?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, just listen!  A body could tell _you_ hain’t ever been to England</span><br/>
<span>by that.  Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’s</span><br/>
<span>end to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger</span><br/>
<span>shows, nor nowheres.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nor church?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nor church.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But _you_ always went to church.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I was gone up again.  I forgot I was the old man’s servant.  But</span><br/>
<span>next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was</span><br/>
<span>different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he</span><br/>
<span>wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the</span><br/>
<span>law.  But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she</span><br/>
<span>warn’t satisfied.  She says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honest injun,” says I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“None of it at all?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“None of it at all.  Not a lie in it,” says I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and</span><br/>
<span>said it.  So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I’ll</span><br/>
<span>believe the rest.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane, stepping in with</span><br/>
<span>Susan behind her.  “It ain’t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,</span><br/>
<span>and him a stranger and so far from his people.  How would you like to be</span><br/>
<span>treated so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before</span><br/>
<span>they’re hurt.  I hain’t done nothing to him.  He’s told some stretchers,</span><br/>
<span>I reckon, and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all; and that’s every bit</span><br/>
<span>and grain I _did_ say.  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,</span><br/>
<span>can’t he?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t care whether ‘twas little or whether ‘twas big; he’s here in</span><br/>
<span>our house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good of you to say it.  If you</span><br/>
<span>was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn’t to</span><br/>
<span>say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Mam, he said--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It don’t make no difference what he _said_--that ain’t the thing.  The</span><br/>
<span>thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make</span><br/>
<span>him remember he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own folks.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I’m letting that old reptile rob</span><br/>
<span>her of her money!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did give</span><br/>
<span>Hare-lip hark from the tomb!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her</span><br/>
<span>of her money!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely</span><br/>
<span>again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardly</span><br/>
<span>anything left o’ poor Hare-lip.  So she hollered.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She done it, too; and she done it beautiful.  She done it so beautiful</span><br/>
<span>it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so</span><br/>
<span>she could do it again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her of</span><br/>
<span>her money.  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves</span><br/>
<span>out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.  I felt so</span><br/>
<span>ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind’s made up;</span><br/>
<span>I’ll hive that money for them or bust.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When</span><br/>
<span>I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,</span><br/>
<span>shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  No--that</span><br/>
<span>won’t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would</span><br/>
<span>make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  No--I</span><br/>
<span>dasn’t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the</span><br/>
<span>money, and they’d slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to</span><br/>
<span>fetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,</span><br/>
<span>I judge.  No; there ain’t no good way but one.  I got to steal that</span><br/>
<span>money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion</span><br/>
<span>that I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t a-going</span><br/>
<span>to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for all they’re</span><br/>
<span>worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll steal it and hide it; and</span><br/>
<span>by and by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write a letter and tell</span><br/>
<span>Mary Jane where it’s hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,</span><br/>
<span>because the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as much as he lets on he has; he</span><br/>
<span>might scare them out of here yet.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was</span><br/>
<span>dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with</span><br/>
<span>my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let</span><br/>
<span>anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to</span><br/>
<span>his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn’t do nothing</span><br/>
<span>without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course.  So I judged I’d</span><br/>
<span>got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time</span><br/>
<span>I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I</span><br/>
<span>reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be; but I touched</span><br/>
<span>the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and</span><br/>
<span>snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to</span><br/>
<span>get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn’t found the bed</span><br/>
<span>when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hide under</span><br/>
<span>the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and</span><br/>
<span>the king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better for</span><br/>
<span>us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ‘em a</span><br/>
<span>chance to talk us over.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable.  That</span><br/>
<span>doctor lays on my mind.  I wanted to know your plans.  I’ve got a</span><br/>
<span>notion, and I think it’s a sound one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What is it, duke?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip</span><br/>
<span>it down the river with what we’ve got.  Specially, seeing we got it so</span><br/>
<span>easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of</span><br/>
<span>course we allowed to have to steal it back.  I’m for knocking off and</span><br/>
<span>lighting out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That made me feel pretty bad.  About an hour or two ago it would a been</span><br/>
<span>a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The</span><br/>
<span>king rips out and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What!  And not sell out the rest o’ the property?  March off like</span><br/>
<span>a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’</span><br/>
<span>property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?--and all good,</span><br/>
<span>salable stuff, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t</span><br/>
<span>want to go no deeper--didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_</span><br/>
<span>they had.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, how you talk!” says the king.  “We sha’n’t rob ‘em of nothing at</span><br/>
<span>all but jest this money.  The people that _buys_ the property is the</span><br/>
<span>suff’rers; because as soon ‘s it’s found out ‘at we didn’t own it--which</span><br/>
<span>won’t be long after we’ve slid--the sale won’t be valid, and it ‘ll all</span><br/>
<span>go back to the estate.  These yer orphans ‘ll git their house back agin,</span><br/>
<span>and that’s enough for _them_; they’re young and spry, and k’n easy</span><br/>
<span>earn a livin’.  _they_ ain’t a-goin to suffer.  Why, jest think--there’s</span><br/>
<span>thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off.  Bless you, _they_</span><br/>
<span>ain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all</span><br/>
<span>right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that</span><br/>
<span>doctor hanging over them.  But the king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cuss the doctor!  What do we k’yer for _him_?  Hain’t we got all the</span><br/>
<span>fools in town on our side?  And ain’t that a big enough majority in any</span><br/>
<span>town?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they got ready to go down stairs again.  The duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t think we put that money in a good place.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That cheered me up.  I’d begun to think I warn’t going to get a hint of</span><br/>
<span>no kind to help me.  The king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because Mary Jane ‘ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know</span><br/>
<span>the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds</span><br/>
<span>up and put ‘em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and</span><br/>
<span>not borrow some of it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling</span><br/>
<span>under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.  I stuck tight to</span><br/>
<span>the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them</span><br/>
<span>fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what</span><br/>
<span>I’d better do if they did catch me.  But the king he got the bag before</span><br/>
<span>I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned</span><br/>
<span>I was around.  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw</span><br/>
<span>tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two</span><br/>
<span>amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only</span><br/>
<span>makes up the feather-bed, and don’t turn over the straw tick only about</span><br/>
<span>twice a year, and so it warn’t in no danger of getting stole now.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But I knowed better.  I had it out of there before they was half-way</span><br/>
<span>down stairs.  I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I</span><br/>
<span>could get a chance to do better.  I judged I better hide it outside</span><br/>
<span>of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the</span><br/>
<span>house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well.  Then I turned in,</span><br/>
<span>with my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wanted</span><br/>
<span>to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.  By and by I</span><br/>
<span>heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid</span><br/>
<span>with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was</span><br/>
<span>going to happen.  But nothing did.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXVII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed</span><br/>
<span>along, and got down stairs all right.  There warn’t a sound anywheres.</span><br/>
<span>I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that</span><br/>
<span>was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door</span><br/>
<span>was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a</span><br/>
<span>candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but</span><br/>
<span>I see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I</span><br/>
<span>shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t there.</span><br/>
<span>Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I</span><br/>
<span>run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I</span><br/>
<span>see to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about</span><br/>
<span>a foot, showing the dead man’s face down in there, with a wet cloth over</span><br/>
<span>it, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just</span><br/>
<span>down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was</span><br/>
<span>so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and</span><br/>
<span>kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see</span><br/>
<span>she begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was to me.  I</span><br/>
<span>slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d make sure them</span><br/>
<span>watchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything</span><br/>
<span>was all right.  They hadn’t stirred.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing</span><br/>
<span>playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much</span><br/>
<span>resk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because</span><br/>
<span>when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to</span><br/>
<span>Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’t the</span><br/>
<span>thing that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is, the</span><br/>
<span>money ‘ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king</span><br/>
<span>‘ll get it again, and it ‘ll be a long day before he gives anybody</span><br/>
<span>another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide</span><br/>
<span>down and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it.  Every minute it was</span><br/>
<span>getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin</span><br/>
<span>to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my</span><br/>
<span>hands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take care of.  I don’t wish to be</span><br/>
<span>mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the</span><br/>
<span>watchers was gone.  There warn’t nobody around but the family and the</span><br/>
<span>widow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything</span><br/>
<span>had been happening, but I couldn’t tell.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they</span><br/>
<span>set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then</span><br/>
<span>set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till</span><br/>
<span>the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin</span><br/>
<span>lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it, with</span><br/>
<span>folks around.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took</span><br/>
<span>seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour</span><br/>
<span>the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the</span><br/>
<span>dead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was</span><br/>
<span>all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding</span><br/>
<span>handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a</span><br/>
<span>little.  There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on</span><br/>
<span>the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a</span><br/>
<span>funeral than they do at other places except church.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his</span><br/>
<span>black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last</span><br/>
<span>touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,</span><br/>
<span>and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people</span><br/>
<span>around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done</span><br/>
<span>it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over</span><br/>
<span>against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever</span><br/>
<span>see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready</span><br/>
<span>a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and</span><br/>
<span>colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one</span><br/>
<span>that had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson</span><br/>
<span>opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most</span><br/>
<span>outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only</span><br/>
<span>one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right</span><br/>
<span>along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody</span><br/>
<span>didn’t seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that</span><br/>
<span>long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,</span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you worry--just depend on me.”  Then he stooped down and begun</span><br/>
<span>to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’s</span><br/>
<span>heads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and</span><br/>
<span>more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two</span><br/>
<span>sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds</span><br/>
<span>we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or</span><br/>
<span>two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn</span><br/>
<span>talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker’s</span><br/>
<span>back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and</span><br/>
<span>glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his</span><br/>
<span>mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,</span><br/>
<span>over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He</span><br/>
<span>had a rat_!”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to</span><br/>
<span>his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,</span><br/>
<span>because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don’t</span><br/>
<span>cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be</span><br/>
<span>looked up to and liked.  There warn’t no more popular man in town than</span><br/>
<span>what that undertaker was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and</span><br/>
<span>then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and</span><br/>
<span>at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the</span><br/>
<span>coffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him</span><br/>
<span>pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as</span><br/>
<span>soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s’pose</span><br/>
<span>somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether</span><br/>
<span>to write to Mary Jane or not? S’pose she dug him up and didn’t find</span><br/>
<span>nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get</span><br/>
<span>hunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at</span><br/>
<span>all; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I’ve worsened it</span><br/>
<span>a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d just let it alone, dad fetch</span><br/>
<span>the whole business!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces</span><br/>
<span>again--I couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy.  But nothing come of</span><br/>
<span>it; the faces didn’t tell me nothing.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,</span><br/>
<span>and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his</span><br/>
<span>congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must</span><br/>
<span>hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was</span><br/>
<span>very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could</span><br/>
<span>stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done.  And he</span><br/>
<span>said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and</span><br/>
<span>that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed</span><br/>
<span>and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled</span><br/>
<span>them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told</span><br/>
<span>him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them</span><br/>
<span>poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them</span><br/>
<span>getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for me to</span><br/>
<span>chip in and change the general tune.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and all</span><br/>
<span>the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;</span><br/>
<span>but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ joy</span><br/>
<span>got the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king</span><br/>
<span>sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called</span><br/>
<span>it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their</span><br/>
<span>mother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them</span><br/>
<span>niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each</span><br/>
<span>other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls</span><br/>
<span>said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold</span><br/>
<span>away from the town.  I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of</span><br/>
<span>them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s necks</span><br/>
<span>and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, but would a had</span><br/>
<span>to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed the sale warn’t no</span><br/>
<span>account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out</span><br/>
<span>flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the</span><br/>
<span>children that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he</span><br/>
<span>bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell</span><br/>
<span>you the duke was powerful uneasy.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and</span><br/>
<span>the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look</span><br/>
<span>that there was trouble.  The king says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Was you in my room night before last?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, your majesty”--which was the way I always called him when nobody but</span><br/>
<span>our gang warn’t around.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, your majesty.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honor bright, now--no lies.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth.  I hain’t been</span><br/>
<span>a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed</span><br/>
<span>it to you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Stop and think.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever</span><br/>
<span>expected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What, all of them?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don’t think I ever see them</span><br/>
<span>all come _out_ at once but just one time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello!  When was that?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn’t early,</span><br/>
<span>because I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see</span><br/>
<span>them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How’d they act?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They didn’t do nothing.  And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as I</span><br/>
<span>see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved in</span><br/>
<span>there to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up;</span><br/>
<span>and found you _warn’t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the</span><br/>
<span>way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you</span><br/>
<span>up.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked</span><br/>
<span>pretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and</span><br/>
<span>scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a</span><br/>
<span>little raspy chuckle, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on</span><br/>
<span>to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they</span><br/>
<span>_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don’t ever tell _me_</span><br/>
<span>any more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way</span><br/>
<span>they played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there’s</span><br/>
<span>a fortune in ‘em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a</span><br/>
<span>better lay-out than that--and here we’ve gone and sold ‘em for a song.</span><br/>
<span>Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that</span><br/>
<span>song--that draft?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, _that’s_ all right then, thank goodness.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says I, kind of timid-like:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is something gone wrong?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king whirls on me and rips out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“None o’ your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y’r own</span><br/>
<span>affairs--if you got any.  Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit</span><br/>
<span>_that_--you hear?”  Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it</span><br/>
<span>and say noth’n’:  mum’s the word for _us_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It’s a good business--yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king snarls around on him and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ‘em out so quick.  If the</span><br/>
<span>profits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none to</span><br/>
<span>carry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, _they’d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn’t_ if I could a got</span><br/>
<span>my advice listened to.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped</span><br/>
<span>around and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not</span><br/>
<span>coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting</span><br/>
<span>that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then</span><br/>
<span>waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not</span><br/>
<span>laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d be</span><br/>
<span>blamed if he’d ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt</span><br/>
<span>dreadful glad I’d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>done the niggers no harm by it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXVIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started</span><br/>
<span>for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open, and</span><br/>
<span>I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she’d</span><br/>
<span>been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she</span><br/>
<span>had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her</span><br/>
<span>hands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I</span><br/>
<span>went in there and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I</span><br/>
<span>can’t--most always.  Tell me about it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said</span><br/>
<span>the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’t</span><br/>
<span>know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and</span><br/>
<span>the children warn’t ever going to see each other no more--and then busted</span><br/>
<span>out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t _ever_ going to see each other any</span><br/>
<span>more!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!” says I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Laws, it was out before I could think!  And before I could budge she</span><br/>
<span>throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it</span><br/>
<span>_again_, say it _again_!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close</span><br/>
<span>place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very</span><br/>
<span>impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and</span><br/>
<span>eased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to</span><br/>
<span>studying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells</span><br/>
<span>the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,</span><br/>
<span>though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it</span><br/>
<span>looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if it</span><br/>
<span>don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.</span><br/>
<span>I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it’s</span><br/>
<span>so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I</span><br/>
<span>says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up and tell the</span><br/>
<span>truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of</span><br/>
<span>powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to. Then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you</span><br/>
<span>could go and stay three or four days?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s.  Why?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Never mind why yet.  If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see</span><br/>
<span>each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how</span><br/>
<span>I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of _you_ than just</span><br/>
<span>your word--I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.”  She</span><br/>
<span>smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it,</span><br/>
<span>I’ll shut the door--and bolt it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I come back and set down again, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you holler.  Just set still and take it like a man.  I got to</span><br/>
<span>tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a</span><br/>
<span>bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for</span><br/>
<span>it.  These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple of</span><br/>
<span>frauds--regular dead-beats.  There, now we’re over the worst of it, you</span><br/>
<span>can stand the rest middling easy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal</span><br/>
<span>water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher</span><br/>
<span>all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck</span><br/>
<span>that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she</span><br/>
<span>flung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed</span><br/>
<span>her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face</span><br/>
<span>afire like sunset, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The brute!  Come, don’t waste a minute--not a _second_--we’ll have them</span><br/>
<span>tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says I:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cert’nly.  But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh,” she says, “what am I _thinking_ about!” she says, and set right</span><br/>
<span>down again.  “Don’t mind what I said--please don’t--you _won’t,_ now,</span><br/>
<span>_will_ you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that</span><br/>
<span>I said I would die first.  “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she</span><br/>
<span>says; “now go on, and I won’t do so any more.  You tell me what to do,</span><br/>
<span>and whatever you say I’ll do it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so</span><br/>
<span>I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I</span><br/>
<span>druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would</span><br/>
<span>get me out of their claws, and I’d be all right; but there’d be another</span><br/>
<span>person that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble.  Well, we</span><br/>
<span>got to save _him_, hain’t we?  Of course.  Well, then, we won’t blow on</span><br/>
<span>them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Saying them words put a good idea in my head.  I see how maybe I could</span><br/>
<span>get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.</span><br/>
<span>But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard</span><br/>
<span>to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin working</span><br/>
<span>till pretty late to-night.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have to stay</span><br/>
<span>at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther.  How fur is it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that ‘ll answer.  Now you go along out there, and lay low</span><br/>
<span>till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home</span><br/>
<span>again--tell them you’ve thought of something.  If you get here before</span><br/>
<span>eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait _till_</span><br/>
<span>eleven, and _then_ if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of the</span><br/>
<span>way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get</span><br/>
<span>these beats jailed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up along</span><br/>
<span>with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,</span><br/>
<span>and you must stand by me all you can.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!”</span><br/>
<span>she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said</span><br/>
<span>it, too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions</span><br/>
<span>ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I _was_ here.  I could swear</span><br/>
<span>they was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something.</span><br/>
<span>Well, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’re</span><br/>
<span>people that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be.  I’ll tell you</span><br/>
<span>how to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--‘Royal</span><br/>
<span>Nonesuch, Bricksville.’  Put it away, and don’t lose it.  When the</span><br/>
<span>court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to</span><br/>
<span>Bricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,</span><br/>
<span>and ask for some witnesses--why, you’ll have that entire town down here</span><br/>
<span>before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they’ll come a-biling, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry.  Nobody don’t</span><br/>
<span>have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction</span><br/>
<span>on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this till</span><br/>
<span>they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going to</span><br/>
<span>count, and they ain’t going to get no money.  It’s just like the way</span><br/>
<span>it was with the niggers--it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be</span><br/>
<span>back before long.  Why, they can’t collect the money for the _niggers_</span><br/>
<span>yet--they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll start</span><br/>
<span>straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Deed, _that_ ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no manner</span><br/>
<span>of means; go _before_ breakfast.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don’t know.  What was it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people.  I don’t</span><br/>
<span>want no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and</span><br/>
<span>read it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your</span><br/>
<span>uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“There, there, don’t!  Yes, I’ll go before breakfast--I’ll be glad to.</span><br/>
<span>And leave my sisters with them?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes; never mind about them.  They’ve got to stand it yet a while.  They</span><br/>
<span>might suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don’t want you to</span><br/>
<span>see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was</span><br/>
<span>to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.</span><br/>
<span>No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all of</span><br/>
<span>them. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say</span><br/>
<span>you’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or</span><br/>
<span>to see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given to</span><br/>
<span>them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.”  It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no</span><br/>
<span>harm in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s</span><br/>
<span>the little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down here below;</span><br/>
<span>it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing.  Then</span><br/>
<span>I says:  “There’s one more thing--that bag of money.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think</span><br/>
<span>_how_ they got it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, you’re out, there.  They hain’t got it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, who’s got it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wish I knowed, but I don’t.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from</span><br/>
<span>them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’m</span><br/>
<span>afraid it ain’t there no more.  I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m</span><br/>
<span>just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I</span><br/>
<span>come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I</span><br/>
<span>come to, and run--and it warn’t a good place.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, stop blaming yourself--it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allow</span><br/>
<span>it--you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault.  Where did you hide it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that</span><br/>
<span>corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So</span><br/>
<span>for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’t</span><br/>
<span>mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and</span><br/>
<span>you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to.  Do you</span><br/>
<span>reckon that ‘ll do?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I wrote:  “I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was</span><br/>
<span>crying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was</span><br/>
<span>mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by</span><br/>
<span>herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own</span><br/>
<span>roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it</span><br/>
<span>to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the</span><br/>
<span>hand, hard, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Good_-bye.  I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and if</span><br/>
<span>I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think of</span><br/>
<span>you a many and a many a time, and I’ll _pray_ for you, too!”--and she was</span><br/>
<span>gone.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more</span><br/>
<span>nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that</span><br/>
<span>kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but</span><br/>
<span>in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in</span><br/>
<span>my opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it</span><br/>
<span>ain’t no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she</span><br/>
<span>lays over them all.  I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see</span><br/>
<span>her go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon</span><br/>
<span>I’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying</span><br/>
<span>she would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good</span><br/>
<span>for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see</span><br/>
<span>her go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the river that</span><br/>
<span>you all goes to see sometimes?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she</span><br/>
<span>told me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of</span><br/>
<span>them’s sick.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Which one?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t _Hanner_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s the very one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary</span><br/>
<span>Jane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Only think of that, now!  What’s the matter with her?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mumps.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mumps your granny!  They don’t set up with people that’s got the</span><br/>
<span>mumps.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They don’t, don’t they?  You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.</span><br/>
<span>These mumps is different.  It’s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How’s it a new kind?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because it’s mixed up with other things.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What other things?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and</span><br/>
<span>yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My land!  And they call it the _mumps_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, because it _is_ the mumps.  That’s what it starts with.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take</span><br/>
<span>pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains</span><br/>
<span>out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull</span><br/>
<span>up and say, ‘Why, he stumped his _toe_.’  Would ther’ be any sense</span><br/>
<span>in that? _No_.  And ther’ ain’t no sense in _this_, nuther.  Is it</span><br/>
<span>ketching?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Is it _ketching_?  Why, how you talk.  Is a _harrow_ catching--in the</span><br/>
<span>dark? If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re bound to on another,</span><br/>
<span>ain’t you? And you can’t get away with that tooth without fetching the</span><br/>
<span>whole harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a</span><br/>
<span>harrow, as you may say--and it ain’t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you</span><br/>
<span>come to get it hitched on good.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip.  “I’ll go to Uncle</span><br/>
<span>Harvey and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, yes,” I says, “I _would_.  Of _course_ I would.  I wouldn’t lose no</span><br/>
<span>time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, why wouldn’t you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain’t your uncles</span><br/>
<span>obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you</span><br/>
<span>reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that</span><br/>
<span>journey by yourselves?  _you_ know they’ll wait for you.  So fur, so</span><br/>
<span>good. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he?  Very well, then; is a</span><br/>
<span>_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive</span><br/>
<span>a _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now</span><br/>
<span>_you_ know he ain’t.  What _will_ he do, then?  Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s a</span><br/>
<span>great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they</span><br/>
<span>can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,</span><br/>
<span>and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months</span><br/>
<span>it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’  But never mind, if you think</span><br/>
<span>it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good</span><br/>
<span>times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s</span><br/>
<span>got it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can’t</span><br/>
<span>you _see_ that _they’d_ go and tell?  Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not</span><br/>
<span>tell anybody at _all_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, maybe you’re right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while,</span><br/>
<span>anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, ‘Tell them to</span><br/>
<span>give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I’ve run over</span><br/>
<span>the river to see Mr.’--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your</span><br/>
<span>uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem to</span><br/>
<span>remember them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run</span><br/>
<span>over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy</span><br/>
<span>this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had</span><br/>
<span>it than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say</span><br/>
<span>they’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s coming home; and</span><br/>
<span>if she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway.  She said, don’t say</span><br/>
<span>nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which ‘ll be</span><br/>
<span>perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying</span><br/>
<span>the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and</span><br/>
<span>give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Everything was all right now.  The girls wouldn’t say nothing because</span><br/>
<span>they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther</span><br/>
<span>Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of</span><br/>
<span>Doctor Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I</span><br/>
<span>reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater himself.  Of course he</span><br/>
<span>would a throwed more style into it, but I can’t do that very handy, not</span><br/>
<span>being brung up to it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end</span><br/>
<span>of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man</span><br/>
<span>he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the</span><br/>
<span>auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little</span><br/>
<span>goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing</span><br/>
<span>for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was</span><br/>
<span>sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So</span><br/>
<span>they’d got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was</span><br/>
<span>for wanting to swallow _everything_.  Well, whilst they was at it a</span><br/>
<span>steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping</span><br/>
<span>and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Here’s_ your opposition line! here’s your two sets o’ heirs to old</span><br/>
<span>Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXIX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a</span><br/>
<span>nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,</span><br/>
<span>how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn’t see no</span><br/>
<span>joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some</span><br/>
<span>to see any.  I reckoned they’d turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did</span><br/>
<span>_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but</span><br/>
<span>just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’s</span><br/>
<span>googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed</span><br/>
<span>down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in</span><br/>
<span>his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the</span><br/>
<span>world.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people</span><br/>
<span>gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old</span><br/>
<span>gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an</span><br/>
<span>Englishman--not the king’s way, though the king’s _was_ pretty good for</span><br/>
<span>an imitation.  I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate</span><br/>
<span>him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll</span><br/>
<span>acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and</span><br/>
<span>answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his</span><br/>
<span>arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the</span><br/>
<span>night by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is his</span><br/>
<span>brother William, which can’t hear nor speak--and can’t even make signs to</span><br/>
<span>amount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with.  We are</span><br/>
<span>who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can</span><br/>
<span>prove it. But up till then I won’t say nothing more, but go to the hotel</span><br/>
<span>and wait.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and</span><br/>
<span>blethers out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain’t_ it?--and very convenient, too,</span><br/>
<span>for a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t learnt how.  Lost</span><br/>
<span>their baggage! That’s _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the</span><br/>
<span>_circumstances_!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,</span><br/>
<span>or maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was</span><br/>
<span>a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind</span><br/>
<span>made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and</span><br/>
<span>was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and</span><br/>
<span>then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone</span><br/>
<span>up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along</span><br/>
<span>and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the</span><br/>
<span>king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to this</span><br/>
<span>town?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But what time o’ day?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“In the evenin’--‘bout an hour er two before sundown.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_How’d_ you come?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_’--in a</span><br/>
<span>canoe?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a lie.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an</span><br/>
<span>old man and a preacher.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint</span><br/>
<span>that mornin’.  I live up there, don’t I?  Well, I was up there, and</span><br/>
<span>he was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim</span><br/>
<span>Collins and a boy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The doctor he up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon I would, but I don’t know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know</span><br/>
<span>him perfectly easy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if</span><br/>
<span>_these_ two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all.  I think it’s our</span><br/>
<span>duty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve looked into</span><br/>
<span>this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We’ll take</span><br/>
<span>these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I</span><br/>
<span>reckon we’ll find out _something_ before we get through.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends; so</span><br/>
<span>we all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by</span><br/>
<span>the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and</span><br/>
<span>fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they’re</span><br/>
<span>frauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know nothing about.</span><br/>
<span>If they have, won’t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter</span><br/>
<span>Wilks left?  It ain’t unlikely.  If these men ain’t frauds, they won’t</span><br/>
<span>object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove</span><br/>
<span>they’re all right--ain’t that so?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty</span><br/>
<span>tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked</span><br/>
<span>sorrowful, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no disposition</span><br/>
<span>to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation</span><br/>
<span>o’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t there; you k’n send</span><br/>
<span>and see, if you want to.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Where is it, then?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it</span><br/>
<span>inside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank it for the few</span><br/>
<span>days we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a safe place, we not bein’</span><br/>
<span>used to niggers, and suppos’n’ ‘em honest, like servants in England.</span><br/>
<span>The niggers stole it the very next mornin’ after I had went down</span><br/>
<span>stairs; and when I sold ‘em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got</span><br/>
<span>clean away with it.  My servant here k’n tell you ‘bout it, gentlemen.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t altogether</span><br/>
<span>believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said</span><br/>
<span>no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I</span><br/>
<span>never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up</span><br/>
<span>my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.</span><br/>
<span>That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Are _you_ English, too?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had</span><br/>
<span>it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about</span><br/>
<span>supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and</span><br/>
<span>kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They</span><br/>
<span>made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his’n;</span><br/>
<span>and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the</span><br/>
<span>old gentleman was spinning truth and t’other one lies.  And by and by</span><br/>
<span>they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed</span><br/>
<span>look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the</span><br/>
<span>right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,</span><br/>
<span>and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn’t get pretty</span><br/>
<span>fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you.  I reckon</span><br/>
<span>you ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want is</span><br/>
<span>practice.  You do it pretty awkward.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,</span><br/>
<span>anyway.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and</span><br/>
<span>reached out his hand, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s wrote so often</span><br/>
<span>about?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked</span><br/>
<span>pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side</span><br/>
<span>and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That ‘ll fix it.  I’ll take the order and send it, along with your</span><br/>
<span>brother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted</span><br/>
<span>his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;</span><br/>
<span>and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the</span><br/>
<span>duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer</span><br/>
<span>turns to the new old gentleman and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it.  The lawyer looked</span><br/>
<span>powerful astonished, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,</span><br/>
<span>and examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then</span><br/>
<span>_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;</span><br/>
<span>and here’s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t</span><br/>
<span>write them” <i>(the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell</span><br/>
<span>you, to see how the lawyer had took them in)</i>, “and here’s _this_ old</span><br/>
<span>gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn’t</span><br/>
<span>write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly _writing_ at</span><br/>
<span>all.  Now, here’s some letters from--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The new old gentleman says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother</span><br/>
<span>there--so he copies for me.  It’s _his_ hand you’ve got there, not mine.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I’ve got some</span><br/>
<span>of William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we</span><br/>
<span>can com--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He _can’t_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he</span><br/>
<span>could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters</span><br/>
<span>and mine too.  Look at both, please--they’re by the same hand.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The lawyer done it, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I believe it’s so--and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger</span><br/>
<span>resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I</span><br/>
<span>thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass,</span><br/>
<span>partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain’t either of ‘em</span><br/>
<span>Wilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in</span><br/>
<span>_then_! Indeed he wouldn’t.  Said it warn’t no fair test.  Said his</span><br/>
<span>brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t tried</span><br/>
<span>to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute</span><br/>
<span>he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and</span><br/>
<span>warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was</span><br/>
<span>saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ve thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay</span><br/>
<span>out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We’re both here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d a</span><br/>
<span>squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took</span><br/>
<span>him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make</span><br/>
<span>most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any</span><br/>
<span>notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?</span><br/>
<span>He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in</span><br/>
<span>there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says</span><br/>
<span>I to myself, _now_ he’ll throw up the sponge--there ain’t no more use.</span><br/>
<span>Well, did he?  A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t.  I reckon</span><br/>
<span>he thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so</span><br/>
<span>they’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.</span><br/>
<span>Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mf!  It’s a _very_ tough question, _ain’t_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k’n</span><br/>
<span>tell you what’s tattooed on his breast.  It’s jest a small, thin, blue</span><br/>
<span>arrow--that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it.</span><br/>
<span>_now_ what do you say--hey?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out</span><br/>
<span>cheek.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and</span><br/>
<span>his eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king _this_ time, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“There--you’ve heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter</span><br/>
<span>Wilks’ breast?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Both of them spoke up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We didn’t see no such mark.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast</span><br/>
<span>was a small dim P, and a B <i>(which is an initial he dropped when he was</span><br/>
<span>young)</i>, and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he marked</span><br/>
<span>them that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain’t that what you saw?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Both of them spoke up again, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, we _didn’t_.  We never seen any marks at all.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The whole _bilin_’ of ‘m ‘s frauds!  Le’s duck ‘em! le’s drown ‘em!</span><br/>
<span>le’s ride ‘em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there</span><br/>
<span>was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you</span><br/>
<span>_please_!  There’s one way yet--let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That took them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer</span><br/>
<span>and the doctor sung out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch</span><br/>
<span>_them_ along, too!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t find them marks we’ll</span><br/>
<span>lynch the whole gang!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn’t no getting away, you</span><br/>
<span>know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the</span><br/>
<span>graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole</span><br/>
<span>town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the</span><br/>
<span>evening.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town;</span><br/>
<span>because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me, and</span><br/>
<span>blow on our dead-beats.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like</span><br/>
<span>wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the</span><br/>
<span>lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst</span><br/>
<span>the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever</span><br/>
<span>was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from</span><br/>
<span>what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time</span><br/>
<span>if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to</span><br/>
<span>save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the</span><br/>
<span>world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they</span><br/>
<span>didn’t find them--</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think</span><br/>
<span>about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful</span><br/>
<span>time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the</span><br/>
<span>wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He</span><br/>
<span>dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it</span><br/>
<span>like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had</span><br/>
<span>about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t</span><br/>
<span>thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the</span><br/>
<span>flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a</span><br/>
<span>mile off, to borrow one.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain</span><br/>
<span>started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come</span><br/>
<span>brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took</span><br/>
<span>no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute</span><br/>
<span>you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the</span><br/>
<span>shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the</span><br/>
<span>dark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then</span><br/>
<span>such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to</span><br/>
<span>scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it</span><br/>
<span>was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,</span><br/>
<span>and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and</span><br/>
<span>panting.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,</span><br/>
<span>and somebody sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and</span><br/>
<span>give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit</span><br/>
<span>out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all</span><br/>
<span>to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the</span><br/>
<span>buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of</span><br/>
<span>the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm, so</span><br/>
<span>I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the</span><br/>
<span>main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and</span><br/>
<span>set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and</span><br/>
<span>disappointed, I didn’t know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,</span><br/>
<span>_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up</span><br/>
<span>sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind</span><br/>
<span>me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this</span><br/>
<span>world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the</span><br/>
<span>towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first</span><br/>
<span>time the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and</span><br/>
<span>shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope.</span><br/>
<span>The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the</span><br/>
<span>middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the</span><br/>
<span>raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp</span><br/>
<span>if I could afforded it.  But I didn’t.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we’re shut</span><br/>
<span>of them!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so</span><br/>
<span>full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up</span><br/>
<span>in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King</span><br/>
<span>Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and</span><br/>
<span>lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and</span><br/>
<span>bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the</span><br/>
<span>king and the duke, but I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and</span><br/>
<span>let her slide!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_</span><br/>
<span>seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and</span><br/>
<span>nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack</span><br/>
<span>my heels a few times--I couldn’t help it; but about the third crack</span><br/>
<span>I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and</span><br/>
<span>listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out</span><br/>
<span>over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and</span><br/>
<span>making their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was</span><br/>
<span>all I could do to keep from crying.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,</span><br/>
<span>hey?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, your majesty, we warn’t--_please_ don’t, your majesty!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I’ll shake the</span><br/>
<span>insides out o’ you!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.</span><br/>
<span>The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he</span><br/>
<span>had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry</span><br/>
<span>to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by</span><br/>
<span>surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go</span><br/>
<span>of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and I lit</span><br/>
<span>out.  It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn’t do nothing,</span><br/>
<span>and I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped</span><br/>
<span>running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,</span><br/>
<span>or they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the</span><br/>
<span>duke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was</span><br/>
<span>awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,</span><br/>
<span>yes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned</span><br/>
<span>he’d drownd me.  But the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did</span><br/>
<span>you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don’t remember it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in</span><br/>
<span>it. But the duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You better a blame’ sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’re</span><br/>
<span>the one that’s entitled to it most.  You hain’t done a thing from the</span><br/>
<span>start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky</span><br/>
<span>with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right</span><br/>
<span>down bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn’t been</span><br/>
<span>for that they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come--and</span><br/>
<span>then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ‘em to the</span><br/>
<span>graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the</span><br/>
<span>excited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a</span><br/>
<span>look we’d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,</span><br/>
<span>too--longer than _we’d_ need ‘em.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of</span><br/>
<span>absent-minded like:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That made me squirm!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_we_</span><br/>
<span>did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After about a half a minute the king drawls out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Leastways, I did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says, the same way:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“On the contrary, I did.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king kind of ruffles up, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says, pretty brisk:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_</span><br/>
<span>referring to?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t know--maybe you was</span><br/>
<span>asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke bristles up now, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’ fool?</span><br/>
<span>Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a lie!”--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Take y’r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,</span><br/>
<span>intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig</span><br/>
<span>it up, and have it all to yourself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;</span><br/>
<span>if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, and</span><br/>
<span>take back everything I said.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.  There, now!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, I b’lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now</span><br/>
<span>_don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and</span><br/>
<span>hide it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway.  But you not</span><br/>
<span>only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.  I won’t say</span><br/>
<span>I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in</span><br/>
<span>ahead o’ me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Nough!--I _own up!_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier</span><br/>
<span>than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.  It’s _well_ for you to set</span><br/>
<span>there and blubber like a baby--it’s fitten for you, after the way</span><br/>
<span>you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble</span><br/>
<span>everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own</span><br/>
<span>father.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it</span><br/>
<span>saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ‘em.</span><br/>
<span>It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_</span><br/>
<span>that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make</span><br/>
<span>up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch</span><br/>
<span>and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dry up!  I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.  “And</span><br/>
<span>_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They’ve got all their own money back,</span><br/>
<span>and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G’long to bed, and</span><br/>
<span>don’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ‘s _you_ live!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,</span><br/>
<span>and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an</span><br/>
<span>hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the</span><br/>
<span>lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.  They</span><br/>
<span>both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow</span><br/>
<span>enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag</span><br/>
<span>again.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got</span><br/>
<span>to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along</span><br/>
<span>down the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty</span><br/>
<span>long ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on</span><br/>
<span>them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the</span><br/>
<span>first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and</span><br/>
<span>dismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they</span><br/>
<span>begun to work the villages again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough</span><br/>
<span>for them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started</span><br/>
<span>a dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a</span><br/>
<span>kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped</span><br/>
<span>in and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at</span><br/>
<span>yellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up and</span><br/>
<span>give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled</span><br/>
<span>missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and</span><br/>
<span>a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have no luck.  So at</span><br/>
<span>last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she</span><br/>
<span>floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the</span><br/>
<span>half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in</span><br/>
<span>the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.</span><br/>
<span>Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn’t like the look of it.  We judged they</span><br/>
<span>was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it</span><br/>
<span>over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break</span><br/>
<span>into somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money</span><br/>
<span>business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an</span><br/>
<span>agreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with such</span><br/>
<span>actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold</span><br/>
<span>shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we</span><br/>
<span>hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of</span><br/>
<span>a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told</span><br/>
<span>us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see</span><br/>
<span>if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. <i>(“House to</span><br/>
<span>rob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it</span><br/>
<span>you’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the</span><br/>
<span>raft--and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”)</i> And he said if he</span><br/>
<span>warn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and</span><br/>
<span>we was to come along.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and</span><br/>
<span>was in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.</span><br/>
<span>Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come</span><br/>
<span>and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_</span><br/>
<span>change on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and</span><br/>
<span>hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the</span><br/>
<span>back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers</span><br/>
<span>bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all</span><br/>
<span>his might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing to</span><br/>
<span>them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king</span><br/>
<span>begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and</span><br/>
<span>shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like</span><br/>
<span>a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a</span><br/>
<span>long day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all</span><br/>
<span>out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Set her loose, Jim! we’re all right now!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was</span><br/>
<span>gone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run</span><br/>
<span>this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’t</span><br/>
<span>no use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help</span><br/>
<span>it. But I couldn’t set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,</span><br/>
<span>trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and</span><br/>
<span>asked him if he’d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Whereabouts?” says I.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here.  He’s a runaway</span><br/>
<span>nigger, and they’ve got him.  Was you looking for him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You bet I ain’t!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two</span><br/>
<span>ago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out--and told me to lay</span><br/>
<span>down and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard</span><br/>
<span>to come out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more, becuz they’ve got him.</span><br/>
<span>He run off f’m down South, som’ers.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a good job they got him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I _reckon_!  There’s two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It’s</span><br/>
<span>like picking up money out’n the road.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I’d been big enough; I see him</span><br/>
<span>_first_. Who nailed him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for</span><br/>
<span>forty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river and can’t wait.  Think</span><br/>
<span>o’ that, now!  You bet _I’d_ wait, if it was seven year.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s me, every time,” says I.  “But maybe his chance ain’t worth</span><br/>
<span>no more than that, if he’ll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there’s something</span><br/>
<span>ain’t straight about it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But it _is_, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.</span><br/>
<span>It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells</span><br/>
<span>the plantation he’s frum, below Newr_leans_.  No-sirree-_bob_, they</span><br/>
<span>ain’t no trouble ‘bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a</span><br/>
<span>chaw tobacker, won’t ye?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the</span><br/>
<span>wigwam to think.  But I couldn’t come to nothing.  I thought till I wore</span><br/>
<span>my head sore, but I couldn’t see no way out of the trouble.  After all</span><br/>
<span>this long journey, and after all we’d done for them scoundrels, here it</span><br/>
<span>was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because</span><br/>
<span>they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make</span><br/>
<span>him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty</span><br/>
<span>dirty dollars.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to</span><br/>
<span>be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d _got_ to be a</span><br/>
<span>slave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to</span><br/>
<span>tell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two</span><br/>
<span>things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness</span><br/>
<span>for leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again;</span><br/>
<span>and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,</span><br/>
<span>and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery and</span><br/>
<span>disgraced. And then think of _me_!  It would get all around that Huck</span><br/>
<span>Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see</span><br/>
<span>anybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his boots</span><br/>
<span>for shame.  That’s just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and</span><br/>
<span>then he don’t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he</span><br/>
<span>can hide it, it ain’t no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I</span><br/>
<span>studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the</span><br/>
<span>more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when</span><br/>
<span>it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence</span><br/>
<span>slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being</span><br/>
<span>watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a</span><br/>
<span>poor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t ever done me no harm, and now was</span><br/>
<span>showing me there’s One that’s always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going</span><br/>
<span>to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,</span><br/>
<span>I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I</span><br/>
<span>could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung</span><br/>
<span>up wicked, and so I warn’t so much to blame; but something inside of me</span><br/>
<span>kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and</span><br/>
<span>if you’d a done it they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as</span><br/>
<span>I’d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So</span><br/>
<span>I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn’t come.  Why wouldn’t they?  It</span><br/>
<span>warn’t no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I</span><br/>
<span>knowed very well why they wouldn’t come.  It was because my heart warn’t</span><br/>
<span>right; it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing</span><br/>
<span>double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was</span><br/>
<span>holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth</span><br/>
<span>_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write</span><br/>
<span>to that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I</span><br/>
<span>knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can’t pray a lie--I found</span><br/>
<span>that out.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what to</span><br/>
<span>do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the letter--and</span><br/>
<span>then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as</span><br/>
<span>light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I</span><br/>
<span>got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down</span><br/>
<span>and wrote:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below</span><br/>
<span>Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the</span><br/>
<span>reward if you send.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>_Huck Finn._</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever</span><br/>
<span>felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn’t do it</span><br/>
<span>straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking</span><br/>
<span>how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost</span><br/>
<span>and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our</span><br/>
<span>trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day</span><br/>
<span>and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we</span><br/>
<span>a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the</span><br/>
<span>other kind.  I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ‘stead of</span><br/>
<span>calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when</span><br/>
<span>I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,</span><br/>
<span>up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call</span><br/>
<span>me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how</span><br/>
<span>good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling</span><br/>
<span>the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was</span><br/>
<span>the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he’s</span><br/>
<span>got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was</span><br/>
<span>a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and</span><br/>
<span>I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then</span><br/>
<span>says to myself:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let</span><br/>
<span>them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the</span><br/>
<span>whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,</span><br/>
<span>which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.  And</span><br/>
<span>for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;</span><br/>
<span>and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as</span><br/>
<span>long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some</span><br/>
<span>considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that</span><br/>
<span>suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down</span><br/>
<span>the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my</span><br/>
<span>raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the</span><br/>
<span>night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,</span><br/>
<span>and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or</span><br/>
<span>another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed</span><br/>
<span>below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the woods,</span><br/>
<span>and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and</span><br/>
<span>sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter</span><br/>
<span>of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on</span><br/>
<span>it, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or</span><br/>
<span>three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t</span><br/>
<span>see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn’t mind,</span><br/>
<span>because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the</span><br/>
<span>lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from</span><br/>
<span>the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,</span><br/>
<span>straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was</span><br/>
<span>the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night</span><br/>
<span>performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I</span><br/>
<span>was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hel-_lo_!  Where’d _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad and</span><br/>
<span>eager, “Where’s the raft?--got her in a good place?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says</span><br/>
<span>to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so I went</span><br/>
<span>a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered</span><br/>
<span>me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch</span><br/>
<span>a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,</span><br/>
<span>and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him</span><br/>
<span>along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after</span><br/>
<span>him.  We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the</span><br/>
<span>country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we</span><br/>
<span>fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and</span><br/>
<span>see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘They’ve got into trouble and had to</span><br/>
<span>leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in</span><br/>
<span>the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property</span><br/>
<span>no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and</span><br/>
<span>cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the</span><br/>
<span>raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blamed if I know--that is, what’s become of the raft.  That old fool had</span><br/>
<span>made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery</span><br/>
<span>the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but</span><br/>
<span>what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and</span><br/>
<span>found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stole our raft and</span><br/>
<span>shook us, and run off down the river.’”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wouldn’t shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the</span><br/>
<span>world, and the only property.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him</span><br/>
<span>_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble</span><br/>
<span>enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,</span><br/>
<span>there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another</span><br/>
<span>shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where’s</span><br/>
<span>that ten cents? Give it here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to</span><br/>
<span>spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the</span><br/>
<span>money I had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never</span><br/>
<span>said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We’d skin him if he done</span><br/>
<span>that!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How can he blow?  Hain’t he run off?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’s</span><br/>
<span>gone.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and</span><br/>
<span>that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you can’t _get_ your nigger, that’s all--so dry up your</span><br/>
<span>blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you’d_ venture to blow on us?</span><br/>
<span>Blamed if I think I’d trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes</span><br/>
<span>before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow, nohow.</span><br/>
<span>I got to turn out and find my nigger.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on</span><br/>
<span>his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you’ll</span><br/>
<span>promise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell you</span><br/>
<span>where to find him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I promised, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, he</span><br/>
<span>started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to</span><br/>
<span>study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he</span><br/>
<span>was. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of</span><br/>
<span>the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he</span><br/>
<span>lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I’ll start this</span><br/>
<span>very afternoon.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No you wont, you’ll start _now_; and don’t you lose any time about it,</span><br/>
<span>neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in</span><br/>
<span>your head and move right along, and then you won’t get into trouble with</span><br/>
<span>_us_, d’ye hear?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I</span><br/>
<span>wanted to be left free to work my plans.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want</span><br/>
<span>to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some</span><br/>
<span>idiots don’t require documents--leastways I’ve heard there’s such down</span><br/>
<span>South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus,</span><br/>
<span>maybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for</span><br/>
<span>getting ‘em out.  Go ‘long now, and tell him anything you want to; but</span><br/>
<span>mind you don’t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn’t look around, but I</span><br/>
<span>kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out</span><br/>
<span>at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before</span><br/>
<span>I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps’.  I</span><br/>
<span>reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling</span><br/>
<span>around, because I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows could</span><br/>
<span>get away.  I didn’t want no trouble with their kind.  I’d seen all I</span><br/>
<span>wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>

<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;</span><br/>
<span>the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint</span><br/>
<span>dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and</span><br/>
<span>like everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers</span><br/>
<span>the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it’s</span><br/>
<span>spirits whispering--spirits that’s been dead ever so many years--and you</span><br/>
<span>always think they’re talking about _you_.  As a general thing it makes a</span><br/>
<span>body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Phelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they</span><br/>
<span>all look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out</span><br/>
<span>of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different</span><br/>
<span>length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when</span><br/>
<span>they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the</span><br/>
<span>big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the</span><br/>
<span>nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,</span><br/>
<span>with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes</span><br/>
<span>been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big</span><br/>
<span>broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house</span><br/>
<span>back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other</span><br/>
<span>side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against</span><br/>
<span>the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;</span><br/>
<span>ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by</span><br/>
<span>the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there</span><br/>
<span>in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away</span><br/>
<span>off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place</span><br/>
<span>by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then</span><br/>
<span>the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and</span><br/>
<span>started for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum</span><br/>
<span>of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;</span><br/>
<span>and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the</span><br/>
<span>lonesomest sound in the whole world.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting</span><br/>
<span>to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for</span><br/>
<span>I’d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth</span><br/>
<span>if I left it alone.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went</span><br/>
<span>for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And</span><br/>
<span>such another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind</span><br/>
<span>of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of</span><br/>
<span>fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses</span><br/>
<span>stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you</span><br/>
<span>could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her</span><br/>
<span>hand, singing out, “Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!” and she</span><br/>
<span>fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,</span><br/>
<span>and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,</span><br/>
<span>wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain’t</span><br/>
<span>no harm in a hound, nohow.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger</span><br/>
<span>boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their</span><br/>
<span>mother’s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way</span><br/>
<span>they always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,</span><br/>
<span>about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick</span><br/>
<span>in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the</span><br/>
<span>same way the little niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she</span><br/>
<span>could hardly stand--and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s _you_, at last!--_ain’t_ it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands</span><br/>
<span>and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;</span><br/>
<span>and she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You</span><br/>
<span>don’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law</span><br/>
<span>sakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it</span><br/>
<span>does seem like I could eat you up!  Children, it’s your cousin Tom!--tell</span><br/>
<span>him howdy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and</span><br/>
<span>hid behind her.  So she run on:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get</span><br/>
<span>your breakfast on the boat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,</span><br/>
<span>leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got</span><br/>
<span>there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on</span><br/>
<span>a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungry</span><br/>
<span>for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come</span><br/>
<span>at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep’</span><br/>
<span>you?--boat get aground?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes’m--she--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t say yes’m--say Aunt Sally.  Where’d she get aground?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether the</span><br/>
<span>boat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on</span><br/>
<span>instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards</span><br/>
<span>Orleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the names</span><br/>
<span>of bars down that way.  I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget the</span><br/>
<span>name of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched</span><br/>
<span>it out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It warn’t the grounding--that didn’t keep us back but a little.  We</span><br/>
<span>blowed out a cylinder-head.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No’m.  Killed a nigger.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago</span><br/>
<span>last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old</span><br/>
<span>Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And</span><br/>
<span>I think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed</span><br/>
<span>a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I</span><br/>
<span>remember now, he _did_ die.  Mortification set in, and they had to</span><br/>
<span>amputate him. But it didn’t save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that</span><br/>
<span>was it.  He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious</span><br/>
<span>resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle’s been up</span><br/>
<span>to the town every day to fetch you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an</span><br/>
<span>hour ago; he’ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,</span><br/>
<span>didn’t you?--oldish man, with a--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,</span><br/>
<span>and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town</span><br/>
<span>and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too</span><br/>
<span>soon; and so I come down the back way.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who’d you give the baggage to?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nobody.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, child, it ‘ll be stole!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was kinder thin ice, but I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something</span><br/>
<span>to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’</span><br/>
<span>lunch, and give me all I wanted.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good.  I had my mind on the</span><br/>
<span>children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump</span><br/>
<span>them a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn’t get no show, Mrs.</span><br/>
<span>Phelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills</span><br/>
<span>streak all down my back, because she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t told me a word</span><br/>
<span>about Sis, nor any of them.  Now I’ll rest my works a little, and you</span><br/>
<span>start up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about ‘m all every</span><br/>
<span>one of ‘m; and how they are, and what they’re doing, and what they told</span><br/>
<span>you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by</span><br/>
<span>me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it</span><br/>
<span>warn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead--I’d got to throw up my hand.  So</span><br/>
<span>I says to myself, here’s another place where I got to resk the truth.</span><br/>
<span>I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind</span><br/>
<span>the bed, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that’ll do; you can’t</span><br/>
<span>be seen now.  Don’t you let on you’re here.  I’ll play a joke on him.</span><br/>
<span>Children, don’t you say a word.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn’t no use to worry; there warn’t</span><br/>
<span>nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from</span><br/>
<span>under when the lightning struck.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then</span><br/>
<span>the bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Has he come?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” says her husband.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good-_ness_ gracious!” she says, “what in the warld can have become of</span><br/>
<span>him?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say it makes me</span><br/>
<span>dreadful uneasy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted!  He _must_ a come; and</span><br/>
<span>you’ve missed him along the road.  I _know_ it’s so--something tells me</span><br/>
<span>so.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Sally, I _couldn’t_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a</span><br/>
<span>missed him.  He--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already distressed.  I don’t know</span><br/>
<span>what in the world to make of it.  I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind</span><br/>
<span>acknowledging ‘t I’m right down scared.  But there’s no hope that he’s</span><br/>
<span>come; for he _couldn’t_ come and me miss him.  Sally, it’s terrible--just</span><br/>
<span>terrible--something’s happened to the boat, sure!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain’t that somebody coming?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.</span><br/>
<span>Phelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the</span><br/>
<span>bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the</span><br/>
<span>window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and</span><br/>
<span>I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, who’s that?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who do you reckon ‘t is?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t no idea.  Who _is_ it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s _Tom Sawyer!_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn’t no time to</span><br/>
<span>swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on</span><br/>
<span>shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and</span><br/>
<span>cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,</span><br/>
<span>and the rest of the tribe.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it was like</span><br/>
<span>being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze</span><br/>
<span>to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the</span><br/>
<span>Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I</span><br/>
<span>explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of</span><br/>
<span>White River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,</span><br/>
<span>and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn’t know but what it would take</span><br/>
<span>three days to fix it.  If I’d a called it a bolthead it would a done</span><br/>
<span>just as well.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty</span><br/>
<span>uncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and</span><br/>
<span>comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a</span><br/>
<span>steamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s’pose</span><br/>
<span>Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s’pose he steps in here any</span><br/>
<span>minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep</span><br/>
<span>quiet?</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I couldn’t _have_ it that way; it wouldn’t do at all.  I must go</span><br/>
<span>up the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go</span><br/>
<span>up to the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for</span><br/>
<span>going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and</span><br/>
<span>I druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a</span><br/>
<span>wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and</span><br/>
<span>waited till he come along.  I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside,</span><br/>
<span>and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed</span><br/>
<span>two or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat, and then says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you</span><br/>
<span>want to come back and ha’nt _me_ for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t come back--I hain’t been _gone_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quite</span><br/>
<span>satisfied yet.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on you.  Honest injun</span><br/>
<span>now, you ain’t a ghost?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can’t somehow</span><br/>
<span>seem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn’t you ever murdered _at</span><br/>
<span>all?_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No.  I warn’t ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in</span><br/>
<span>here and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me</span><br/>
<span>again he didn’t know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it</span><br/>
<span>right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it</span><br/>
<span>hit him where he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and</span><br/>
<span>told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told</span><br/>
<span>him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He</span><br/>
<span>said, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him.  So he thought and</span><br/>
<span>thought, and pretty soon he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s all right; I’ve got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on</span><br/>
<span>it’s your’n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the</span><br/>
<span>house about the time you ought to; and I’ll go towards town a piece, and</span><br/>
<span>take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;</span><br/>
<span>and you needn’t let on to know me at first.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right; but wait a minute.  There’s one more thing--a thing that</span><br/>
<span>_nobody_ don’t know but me.  And that is, there’s a nigger here that</span><br/>
<span>I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss</span><br/>
<span>Watson’s Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What!  Why, Jim is--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He stopped and went to studying.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know what you’ll say.  You’ll say it’s dirty, low-down business; but</span><br/>
<span>what if it is?  I’m low down; and I’m a-going to steal him, and I want</span><br/>
<span>you keep mum and not let on.  Will you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>His eye lit up, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll _help_ you steal him!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most</span><br/>
<span>astonishing speech I ever heard--and I’m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell</span><br/>
<span>considerable in my estimation.  Only I couldn’t believe it.  Tom Sawyer</span><br/>
<span>a _nigger-stealer!_</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, shucks!”  I says; “you’re joking.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I ain’t joking, either.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear anything said</span><br/>
<span>about a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that _you_ don’t know</span><br/>
<span>nothing about him, and I don’t know nothing about him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his</span><br/>
<span>way and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on</span><br/>
<span>accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too</span><br/>
<span>quick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and</span><br/>
<span>he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare</span><br/>
<span>to do it?  I wish we’d a timed her.  And she hain’t sweated a hair--not</span><br/>
<span>a hair. It’s wonderful.  Why, I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that</span><br/>
<span>horse now--I wouldn’t, honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before,</span><br/>
<span>and thought ‘twas all she was worth.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That’s all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.</span><br/>
<span>But it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only just a farmer, he was</span><br/>
<span>a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the</span><br/>
<span>plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church</span><br/>
<span>and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was</span><br/>
<span>worth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and</span><br/>
<span>done the same way, down South.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt</span><br/>
<span>Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty</span><br/>
<span>yards, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, there’s somebody come!  I wonder who ‘tis?  Why, I do believe it’s</span><br/>
<span>a stranger.  Jimmy” <i>(that’s one of the children)</i> “run and tell Lize to</span><br/>
<span>put on another plate for dinner.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger</span><br/>
<span>don’t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for</span><br/>
<span>interest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for</span><br/>
<span>the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we</span><br/>
<span>was all bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an</span><br/>
<span>audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances</span><br/>
<span>it warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was</span><br/>
<span>suitable.  He warn’t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,</span><br/>
<span>he come ca’m and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he</span><br/>
<span>lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box</span><br/>
<span>that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn’t want to disturb them,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry to say ‘t your driver</span><br/>
<span>has deceived you; Nichols’s place is down a matter of three mile more.</span><br/>
<span>Come in, come in.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late--he’s out</span><br/>
<span>of sight.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with</span><br/>
<span>us; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, I _can’t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn’t think of it.  I’ll</span><br/>
<span>walk--I don’t mind the distance.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But we won’t _let_ you walk--it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to do</span><br/>
<span>it. Come right in.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not a</span><br/>
<span>bit in the world.  You must stay.  It’s a long, dusty three mile, and</span><br/>
<span>we can’t let you walk.  And, besides, I’ve already told ‘em to put on</span><br/>
<span>another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us.  Come</span><br/>
<span>right in and make yourself at home.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be</span><br/>
<span>persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger</span><br/>
<span>from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made</span><br/>
<span>another bow.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and</span><br/>
<span>everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and</span><br/>
<span>wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,</span><br/>
<span>still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the</span><br/>
<span>mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was</span><br/>
<span>going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of</span><br/>
<span>her hand, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You owdacious puppy!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked kind of hurt, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m surprised at you, m’am.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You’re s’rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I’ve a good notion to take</span><br/>
<span>and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked kind of humble, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am.  I didn’t mean no harm.  I--I--thought you’d</span><br/>
<span>like it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, you born fool!”  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked</span><br/>
<span>like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.</span><br/>
<span>“What made you think I’d like it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I don’t know.  Only, they--they--told me you would.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_They_ told you I would.  Whoever told you’s _another_ lunatic.  I</span><br/>
<span>never heard the beat of it.  Who’s _they_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, everybody.  They all said so, m’am.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her</span><br/>
<span>fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who’s ‘everybody’?  Out with their names, or ther’ll be an idiot</span><br/>
<span>short.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told</span><br/>
<span>me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she’d like it.  They all said</span><br/>
<span>it--every one of them.  But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more--I</span><br/>
<span>won’t, honest.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You won’t, won’t you?  Well, I sh’d _reckon_ you won’t!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it again--till you ask me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Till I _ask_ you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!</span><br/>
<span>I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask</span><br/>
<span>you--or the likes of you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so.  I can’t make it out, somehow.</span><br/>
<span>They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--” He stopped and</span><br/>
<span>looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye</span><br/>
<span>somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and says, “Didn’t</span><br/>
<span>_you_ think she’d like me to kiss her, sir?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tom, didn’t _you_ think Aunt Sally ‘d open out her arms and say, ‘Sid</span><br/>
<span>Sawyer--’”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudent</span><br/>
<span>young rascal, to fool a body so--” and was going to hug him, but he</span><br/>
<span>fended her off, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, not till you’ve asked me first.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed</span><br/>
<span>him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he</span><br/>
<span>took what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn’t looking for _you_</span><br/>
<span>at all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but</span><br/>
<span>him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s because it warn’t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” he</span><br/>
<span>says; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me</span><br/>
<span>come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a</span><br/>
<span>first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me</span><br/>
<span>to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it</span><br/>
<span>was a mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain’t no healthy place for a stranger</span><br/>
<span>to come.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I</span><br/>
<span>hain’t been so put out since I don’t know when.  But I don’t care, I</span><br/>
<span>don’t mind the terms--I’d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to</span><br/>
<span>have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don’t deny it, I</span><br/>
<span>was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and</span><br/>
<span>the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven</span><br/>
<span>families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laid</span><br/>
<span>in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of</span><br/>
<span>old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long</span><br/>
<span>blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit,</span><br/>
<span>neither, the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.</span><br/>
<span>There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me</span><br/>
<span>and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they</span><br/>
<span>didn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid</span><br/>
<span>to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little</span><br/>
<span>boys says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t going to be any; and you</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and</span><br/>
<span>me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the</span><br/>
<span>people; so I reckon they’ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town</span><br/>
<span>before this time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So there it was!--but I couldn’t help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the</span><br/>
<span>same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to</span><br/>
<span>bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the</span><br/>
<span>lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe anybody was</span><br/>
<span>going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’t hurry up</span><br/>
<span>and give them one they’d get into trouble sure.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,</span><br/>
<span>and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back no more, and</span><br/>
<span>what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our</span><br/>
<span>Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had</span><br/>
<span>time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of</span><br/>
<span>it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of</span><br/>
<span>people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin</span><br/>
<span>pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;</span><br/>
<span>and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a</span><br/>
<span>rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was</span><br/>
<span>all over tar and feathers, and didn’t look like nothing in the</span><br/>
<span>world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big</span><br/>
<span>soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for</span><br/>
<span>them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any</span><br/>
<span>hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to</span><br/>
<span>see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We see we was too late--couldn’t do no good.  We asked some stragglers</span><br/>
<span>about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very</span><br/>
<span>innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the</span><br/>
<span>middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and</span><br/>
<span>the house rose up and went for them.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was</span><br/>
<span>before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though</span><br/>
<span>I hadn’t done nothing.  But that’s always the way; it don’t make no</span><br/>
<span>difference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s conscience ain’t</span><br/>
<span>got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that</span><br/>
<span>didn’t know no more than a person’s conscience does I would pison him.</span><br/>
<span>It takes up more room than all the rest of a person’s insides, and yet</span><br/>
<span>ain’t no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXIV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I</span><br/>
<span>know where Jim is.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No!  Where?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at</span><br/>
<span>dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What did you think the vittles was for?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“For a dog.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So ‘d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because part of it was watermelon.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought</span><br/>
<span>about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and</span><br/>
<span>don’t see at the same time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it</span><br/>
<span>again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up</span><br/>
<span>from table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;</span><br/>
<span>and it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a little plantation,</span><br/>
<span>and where the people’s all so kind and good.  Jim’s the prisoner.  All</span><br/>
<span>right--I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks</span><br/>
<span>for any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to</span><br/>
<span>steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like</span><br/>
<span>the best.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer’s head I</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown</span><br/>
<span>in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,</span><br/>
<span>but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right</span><br/>
<span>plan was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ready?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right--bring it out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My plan is this,” I says.  “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there.</span><br/>
<span>Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the</span><br/>
<span>island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the</span><br/>
<span>old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river</span><br/>
<span>on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and</span><br/>
<span>Jim used to do before.  Wouldn’t that plan work?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Work_?  Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it’s</span><br/>
<span>too blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing _to_ it.  What’s the good of a</span><br/>
<span>plan that ain’t no more trouble than that?  It’s as mild as goose-milk.</span><br/>
<span>Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap</span><br/>
<span>factory.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; but</span><br/>
<span>I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>have none of them objections to it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And it didn’t.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was</span><br/>
<span>worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man</span><br/>
<span>as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied,</span><br/>
<span>and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn’t tell what it was here,</span><br/>
<span>because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be</span><br/>
<span>changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new</span><br/>
<span>bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in</span><br/>
<span>earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.</span><br/>
<span>That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was</span><br/>
<span>respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at</span><br/>
<span>home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and</span><br/>
<span>knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,</span><br/>
<span>without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to</span><br/>
<span>this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,</span><br/>
<span>before everybody.  I _couldn’t_ understand it no way at all.  It was</span><br/>
<span>outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be</span><br/>
<span>his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save</span><br/>
<span>himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about?  Don’t I generly know what I’m</span><br/>
<span>about?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Didn’t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Well_, then.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That’s all he said, and that’s all I said.  It warn’t no use to say any</span><br/>
<span>more; because when he said he’d do a thing, he always done it.  But I</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just</span><br/>
<span>let it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have</span><br/>
<span>it so, I couldn’t help it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to</span><br/>
<span>the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard</span><br/>
<span>so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn’t make</span><br/>
<span>no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by</span><br/>
<span>in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and</span><br/>
<span>the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with--which was the</span><br/>
<span>north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just</span><br/>
<span>one stout board nailed across it.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here’s the ticket.  This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we</span><br/>
<span>wrench off the board.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as</span><br/>
<span>playing hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that’s a little more</span><br/>
<span>complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then,” I says, “how ‘ll it do to saw him out, the way I done</span><br/>
<span>before I was murdered that time?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That’s more _like_,” he says.  “It’s real mysterious, and troublesome,</span><br/>
<span>and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long.</span><br/>
<span>There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that</span><br/>
<span>joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long</span><br/>
<span>as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at</span><br/>
<span>the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and</span><br/>
<span>searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;</span><br/>
<span>so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,</span><br/>
<span>and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,</span><br/>
<span>and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t no connection</span><br/>
<span>with it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but</span><br/>
<span>some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.</span><br/>
<span>The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and</span><br/>
<span>the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now we’re all right.  We’ll _dig_ him out.  It ‘ll take about a week!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have</span><br/>
<span>to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors--but that</span><br/>
<span>warn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must</span><br/>
<span>climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three</span><br/>
<span>times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most</span><br/>
<span>busted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but after he</span><br/>
<span>was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this</span><br/>
<span>time he made the trip.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins</span><br/>
<span>to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it</span><br/>
<span>_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through</span><br/>
<span>breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up</span><br/>
<span>a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was</span><br/>
<span>leaving, the key come from the house.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was</span><br/>
<span>all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches</span><br/>
<span>off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and</span><br/>
<span>making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of</span><br/>
<span>strange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so</span><br/>
<span>long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so</span><br/>
<span>about his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do.</span><br/>
<span>So Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you</span><br/>
<span>heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur’us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at</span><br/>
<span>‘im?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I hunched Tom, and whispers:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You going, right here in the daybreak?  _that_ warn’t the plan.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan _now_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much.  When we got in</span><br/>
<span>we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure</span><br/>
<span>enough, and could see us; and he sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn’t know</span><br/>
<span>nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that nigger</span><br/>
<span>busted in and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and</span><br/>
<span>kind of wondering, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Does _who_ know us?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What _put_ it dar?  Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed</span><br/>
<span>you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that’s mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?</span><br/>
<span>_what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says,</span><br/>
<span>“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Of course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did you sing out?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Not a word?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did you ever see us before?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah; not as I knows on.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and</span><br/>
<span>says, kind of severe:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think</span><br/>
<span>somebody sung out?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.</span><br/>
<span>Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so.</span><br/>
<span>Please to don’t tell nobody ‘bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scole</span><br/>
<span>me; ‘kase he say dey _ain’t_ no witches.  I jis’ wish to goodness he was</span><br/>
<span>heah now--_den_ what would he say!  I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way to</span><br/>
<span>git aroun’ it _dis_ time.  But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s _sot_,</span><br/>
<span>stays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, en</span><br/>
<span>when _you_ fine it out en tell um ‘bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him to</span><br/>
<span>buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to</span><br/>
<span>catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give</span><br/>
<span>him up, I’d hang him.”  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to</span><br/>
<span>look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on</span><br/>
<span>nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger</span><br/>
<span>come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted</span><br/>
<span>us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the</span><br/>
<span>witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks</span><br/>
<span>around then.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down</span><br/>
<span>into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how</span><br/>
<span>to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;</span><br/>
<span>what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that’s called</span><br/>
<span>fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a</span><br/>
<span>dark place.  We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down</span><br/>
<span>to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.</span><br/>
<span>And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.</span><br/>
<span>There ain’t no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a</span><br/>
<span>watchman.  There ain’t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And</span><br/>
<span>there’s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his</span><br/>
<span>bed:  why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off</span><br/>
<span>the chain.  And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the</span><br/>
<span>punkin-headed nigger, and don’t send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim</span><br/>
<span>could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be</span><br/>
<span>no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,</span><br/>
<span>Huck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_</span><br/>
<span>the difficulties.  Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we can</span><br/>
<span>with the materials we’ve got. Anyhow, there’s one thing--there’s more</span><br/>
<span>honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,</span><br/>
<span>where there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was</span><br/>
<span>their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your</span><br/>
<span>own head.  Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you</span><br/>
<span>come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern’s</span><br/>
<span>resky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,</span><br/>
<span>I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to</span><br/>
<span>make a saw out of the first chance we get.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do we want of a saw?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do we _want_ of it?  Hain’t we got to saw the leg of Jim’s bed</span><br/>
<span>off, so as to get the chain loose?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain</span><br/>
<span>off.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, if that ain’t just like you, Huck Finn.  You _can_ get up the</span><br/>
<span>infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain’t you ever read</span><br/>
<span>any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,</span><br/>
<span>nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a</span><br/>
<span>prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the</span><br/>
<span>best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just</span><br/>
<span>so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be found, and put some dirt and</span><br/>
<span>grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’t see</span><br/>
<span>no sign of it’s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.</span><br/>
<span>Then, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip</span><br/>
<span>off your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your</span><br/>
<span>rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the</span><br/>
<span>moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and</span><br/>
<span>there’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and</span><br/>
<span>fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or</span><br/>
<span>Navarre, or wherever it is. It’s gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat</span><br/>
<span>to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out from under</span><br/>
<span>the cabin?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had</span><br/>
<span>his chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his</span><br/>
<span>head; then sighs again, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, it wouldn’t do--there ain’t necessity enough for it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“For what?”  I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good land!”  I says; “why, there ain’t _no_ necessity for it.  And what</span><br/>
<span>would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn’t get the</span><br/>
<span>chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would</span><br/>
<span>be better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain’t necessity</span><br/>
<span>enough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a nigger, and wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>understand the reasons for it, and how it’s the custom in Europe; so</span><br/>
<span>we’ll let it go.  But there’s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we</span><br/>
<span>can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we</span><br/>
<span>can send it to him in a pie; it’s mostly done that way.  And I’ve et</span><br/>
<span>worse pies.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t got no use for a</span><br/>
<span>rope ladder.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He _has_ got use for it.  How _you_ talk, you better say; you don’t</span><br/>
<span>know nothing about it.  He’s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What in the nation can he _do_ with it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Do_ with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can’t he?”  That’s what they</span><br/>
<span>all do; and _he’s_ got to, too.  Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to do</span><br/>
<span>anything that’s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the</span><br/>
<span>time. S’pose he _don’t_ do nothing with it? ain’t it there in his bed,</span><br/>
<span>for a clew, after he’s gone? and don’t you reckon they’ll want clews?</span><br/>
<span>Of course they will.  And you wouldn’t leave them any?  That would be a</span><br/>
<span>_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn’t_ it!  I never heard of such a thing.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and he’s got to have</span><br/>
<span>it, all right, let him have it; because I don’t wish to go back on no</span><br/>
<span>regulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up</span><br/>
<span>our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we’re going to get into trouble</span><br/>
<span>with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re born.  Now, the way I look at</span><br/>
<span>it, a hickry-bark ladder don’t cost nothing, and don’t waste nothing,</span><br/>
<span>and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,</span><br/>
<span>as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain’t had no</span><br/>
<span>experience, and so he don’t care what kind of a--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I’d keep</span><br/>
<span>still--that’s what I’D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping</span><br/>
<span>by a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take my</span><br/>
<span>advice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Borrow a shirt, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Journal your granny--_Jim_ can’t write.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“S’pose he _can’t_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can’t he, if</span><br/>
<span>we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron</span><br/>
<span>barrel-hoop?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better</span><br/>
<span>one; and quicker, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Prisoners_ don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull</span><br/>
<span>pens out of, you muggins.  They _always_ make their pens out of the</span><br/>
<span>hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or</span><br/>
<span>something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks</span><br/>
<span>and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they’ve got</span><br/>
<span>to do it by rubbing it on the wall.  _They_ wouldn’t use a goose-quill</span><br/>
<span>if they had it. It ain’t regular.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the common sort</span><br/>
<span>and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that;</span><br/>
<span>and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message</span><br/>
<span>to let the world know where he’s captivated, he can write it on the</span><br/>
<span>bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The</span><br/>
<span>Iron Mask always done that, and it’s a blame’ good way, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jim ain’t got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That ain’t nothing; we can get him some.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Can’t nobody _read_ his plates.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That ain’t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.  All _he’s_ got to</span><br/>
<span>do is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don’t _have_ to be</span><br/>
<span>able to read it. Why, half the time you can’t read anything a prisoner</span><br/>
<span>writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, blame it all, it ain’t the _prisoner’s_ plates.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But it’s _somebody’s_ plates, ain’t it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, spos’n it is?  What does the _prisoner_ care whose--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we</span><br/>
<span>cleared out for the house.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the</span><br/>
<span>clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went</span><br/>
<span>down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,</span><br/>
<span>because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t</span><br/>
<span>borrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and</span><br/>
<span>prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody</span><br/>
<span>don’t blame them for it, either.  It ain’t no crime in a prisoner to</span><br/>
<span>steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’s his right; and</span><br/>
<span>so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to</span><br/>
<span>steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves</span><br/>
<span>out of prison with.  He said if we warn’t prisoners it would be a very</span><br/>
<span>different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when</span><br/>
<span>he warn’t a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was</span><br/>
<span>that come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,</span><br/>
<span>when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he</span><br/>
<span>made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it</span><br/>
<span>was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we</span><br/>
<span>_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn’t</span><br/>
<span>need it to get out of prison with; there’s where the difference was.</span><br/>
<span>He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim</span><br/>
<span>to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at</span><br/>
<span>that, though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner</span><br/>
<span>if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like</span><br/>
<span>that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled</span><br/>
<span>down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he</span><br/>
<span>carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep</span><br/>
<span>watch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile</span><br/>
<span>to talk.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s easy fixed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tools?”  I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tools for what?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, to dig with.  We ain’t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a</span><br/>
<span>nigger out with?”  I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,</span><br/>
<span>and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?</span><br/>
<span>Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what</span><br/>
<span>kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as</span><br/>
<span>well lend him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t furnish ‘em to a king.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks and shovels, what do</span><br/>
<span>we want?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A couple of case-knives.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It don’t make no difference how foolish it is, it’s the _right_ way--and</span><br/>
<span>it’s the regular way.  And there ain’t no _other_ way, that ever I heard</span><br/>
<span>of, and I’ve read all the books that gives any information about these</span><br/>
<span>things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind</span><br/>
<span>you; generly it’s through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks</span><br/>
<span>and weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in</span><br/>
<span>the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that</span><br/>
<span>dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, guess.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know.  A month and a half.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China.  _That’s_ the kind.  I</span><br/>
<span>wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Jim_ don’t know nobody in China.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s _that_ got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  But</span><br/>
<span>you’re always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can’t you stick to</span><br/>
<span>the main point?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right--I don’t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim</span><br/>
<span>don’t, either, I reckon.  But there’s one thing, anyway--Jim’s too old to</span><br/>
<span>be dug out with a case-knife.  He won’t last.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes he will _last_, too.  You don’t reckon it’s going to take</span><br/>
<span>thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How long will it take, Tom?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn’t</span><br/>
<span>take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.</span><br/>
<span>He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there.  Then his next move will be to</span><br/>
<span>advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we can’t resk being as long</span><br/>
<span>digging him out as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be</span><br/>
<span>a couple of years; but we can’t.  Things being so uncertain, what I</span><br/>
<span>recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;</span><br/>
<span>and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it</span><br/>
<span>thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the</span><br/>
<span>first time there’s an alarm.  Yes, I reckon that ‘ll be the best way.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now, there’s _sense_ in that,” I says.  “Letting on don’t cost nothing;</span><br/>
<span>letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t mind</span><br/>
<span>letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn’t strain</span><br/>
<span>me none, after I got my hand in.  So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a</span><br/>
<span>couple of case-knives.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,</span><br/>
<span>“there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the</span><br/>
<span>weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and</span><br/>
<span>smouch the knives--three of them.”  So I done it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXVI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the</span><br/>
<span>lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our</span><br/>
<span>pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the</span><br/>
<span>way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom</span><br/>
<span>said he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and</span><br/>
<span>when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there</span><br/>
<span>was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the</span><br/>
<span>ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.</span><br/>
<span>So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then</span><br/>
<span>we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see</span><br/>
<span>we’d done anything hardly.  At last I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,</span><br/>
<span>Tom Sawyer.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped</span><br/>
<span>digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.</span><br/>
<span>Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work.  If we was prisoners</span><br/>
<span>it would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no</span><br/>
<span>hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while</span><br/>
<span>they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and</span><br/>
<span>we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,</span><br/>
<span>and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can’t fool along; we got to</span><br/>
<span>rush; we ain’t got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another</span><br/>
<span>night this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get</span><br/>
<span>well--couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll tell you.  It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like</span><br/>
<span>it to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way:  we got to dig him</span><br/>
<span>out with the picks, and _let on_ it’s case-knives.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Now_ you’re _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler</span><br/>
<span>all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no</span><br/>
<span>moral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.</span><br/>
<span>When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school</span><br/>
<span>book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done.  What I</span><br/>
<span>want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my</span><br/>
<span>Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing</span><br/>
<span>I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school</span><br/>
<span>book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks</span><br/>
<span>about it nuther.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like</span><br/>
<span>this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by</span><br/>
<span>and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,</span><br/>
<span>and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and</span><br/>
<span>knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,</span><br/>
<span>_without_ any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gimme a _case-knife_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I didn’t know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around</span><br/>
<span>amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took</span><br/>
<span>it and went to work, and never said a word.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,</span><br/>
<span>and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as</span><br/>
<span>long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for</span><br/>
<span>it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing</span><br/>
<span>his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his</span><br/>
<span>hands was so sore.  At last he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can’t</span><br/>
<span>you think of no way?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.  Come up the stairs, and</span><br/>
<span>let on it’s a lightning-rod.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he done it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,</span><br/>
<span>for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I</span><br/>
<span>hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin</span><br/>
<span>plates.  Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see</span><br/>
<span>the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel</span><br/>
<span>and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and</span><br/>
<span>he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard</span><br/>
<span>of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he</span><br/>
<span>said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to</span><br/>
<span>decide on any of them yet.  Said we’d got to post Jim first.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took</span><br/>
<span>one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard</span><br/>
<span>Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him.  Then we</span><br/>
<span>whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half</span><br/>
<span>the job was done.  We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and</span><br/>
<span>pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,</span><br/>
<span>and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle</span><br/>
<span>and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us</span><br/>
<span>honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us</span><br/>
<span>hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,</span><br/>
<span>and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how</span><br/>
<span>unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,</span><br/>
<span>and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and</span><br/>
<span>not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.</span><br/>
<span>So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old</span><br/>
<span>times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told</span><br/>
<span>him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt</span><br/>
<span>Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and</span><br/>
<span>both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We’ll send you some things by them.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the most jackass</span><br/>
<span>ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right</span><br/>
<span>on.  It was his way when he’d got his plans set.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other</span><br/>
<span>large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the</span><br/>
<span>lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and</span><br/>
<span>we would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal them</span><br/>
<span>out; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put them in her</span><br/>
<span>apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and</span><br/>
<span>what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with</span><br/>
<span>his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn’t see</span><br/>
<span>no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed</span><br/>
<span>better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just</span><br/>
<span>as Tom said.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good</span><br/>
<span>sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to</span><br/>
<span>bed, with hands that looked like they’d been chawed.  Tom was in high</span><br/>
<span>spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the</span><br/>
<span>most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would</span><br/>
<span>keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to</span><br/>
<span>get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the</span><br/>
<span>more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out</span><br/>
<span>to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he</span><br/>
<span>said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass</span><br/>
<span>candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in</span><br/>
<span>his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s</span><br/>
<span>notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a</span><br/>
<span>corn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how</span><br/>
<span>it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most</span><br/>
<span>mashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a worked</span><br/>
<span>better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only</span><br/>
<span>just a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting into</span><br/>
<span>bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he</span><br/>
<span>jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a</span><br/>
<span>couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept on</span><br/>
<span>piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly room</span><br/>
<span>in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to</span><br/>
<span>door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled</span><br/>
<span>over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was</span><br/>
<span>dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim’s meat,</span><br/>
<span>and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back</span><br/>
<span>again and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door too.</span><br/>
<span>Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and</span><br/>
<span>asking him if he’d been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,</span><br/>
<span>and blinked his eyes around, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t b’lieve I see most a</span><br/>
<span>million dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese</span><br/>
<span>tracks.  I did, mos’ sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey</span><br/>
<span>was all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis’ wisht I could git my han’s on one</span><br/>
<span>er dem witches jis’ wunst--on’y jis’ wunst--it’s all I’d ast.  But mos’ly</span><br/>
<span>I wisht dey’d lemme ‘lone, I does.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this</span><br/>
<span>runaway nigger’s breakfast-time?  It’s because they’re hungry; that’s</span><br/>
<span>the reason.  You make them a witch pie; that’s the thing for _you_ to</span><br/>
<span>do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to make ‘m a witch pie?  I doan’</span><br/>
<span>know how to make it.  I hain’t ever hearn er sich a thing b’fo’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, I’ll have to make it myself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I’ll wusshup de groun’ und’ yo’ foot,</span><br/>
<span>I will!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, I’ll do it, seeing it’s you, and you’ve been good to us and</span><br/>
<span>showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When</span><br/>
<span>we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we’ve put in the</span><br/>
<span>pan, don’t you let on you see it at all.  And don’t you look when Jim</span><br/>
<span>unloads the pan--something might happen, I don’t know what.  And above</span><br/>
<span>all, don’t you _handle_ the witch-things.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Hannel ‘M_, Mars Sid?  What _is_ you a-talkin’ ‘bout?  I wouldn’</span><br/>
<span>lay de weight er my finger on um, not f’r ten hund’d thous’n billion</span><br/>
<span>dollars, I wouldn’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXVII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile</span><br/>
<span>in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces</span><br/>
<span>of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched</span><br/>
<span>around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as</span><br/>
<span>we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full</span><br/>
<span>of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails</span><br/>
<span>that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and</span><br/>
<span>sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt</span><br/>
<span>Sally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’other we stuck</span><br/>
<span>in the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau, because we</span><br/>
<span>heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger’s</span><br/>
<span>house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the</span><br/>
<span>pewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn’t come</span><br/>
<span>yet, so we had to wait a little while.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly</span><br/>
<span>wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one</span><br/>
<span>hand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble with the</span><br/>
<span>other, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_</span><br/>
<span>become of your other shirt.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard</span><br/>
<span>piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the</span><br/>
<span>road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the</span><br/>
<span>children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry</span><br/>
<span>out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around</span><br/>
<span>the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for</span><br/>
<span>about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out</span><br/>
<span>for half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right</span><br/>
<span>again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.</span><br/>
<span>Uncle Silas he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it.  I know perfectly</span><br/>
<span>well I took it _off_, because--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Because you hain’t got but one _on_.  Just _listen_ at the man!  I know</span><br/>
<span>you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering</span><br/>
<span>memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line yesterday--I see it there</span><br/>
<span>myself. But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll</span><br/>
<span>just have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a</span><br/>
<span>new one. And it ‘ll be the third I’ve made in two years.  It just keeps</span><br/>
<span>a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to</span><br/>
<span>_do_ with ‘m all is more’n I can make out.  A body ‘d think you _would_</span><br/>
<span>learn to take some sort of care of ‘em at your time of life.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn’t to be</span><br/>
<span>altogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor have</span><br/>
<span>nothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believe</span><br/>
<span>I’ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it ain’t _your_ fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it</span><br/>
<span>if you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther.</span><br/>
<span>Ther’s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain’t all.  There was ten, and now</span><br/>
<span>ther’s only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never</span><br/>
<span>took the spoon, _that’s_ certain.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ther’s six _candles_ gone--that’s what.  The rats could a got the</span><br/>
<span>candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with the</span><br/>
<span>whole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’t</span><br/>
<span>do it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas--_you’d_</span><br/>
<span>never find it out; but you can’t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I</span><br/>
<span>know.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; but</span><br/>
<span>I won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year ‘ll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta</span><br/>
<span>_Phelps!_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the</span><br/>
<span>sugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps</span><br/>
<span>on to the passage, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A _sheet_ gone!  Well, for the land’s sake!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, _do_ shet up!--s’pose the rats took the _sheet_?  _where’s_ it gone,</span><br/>
<span>Lize?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally.  She wuz on de</span><br/>
<span>clo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain’ dah no mo’ now.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.  I _never_ see the beat of it</span><br/>
<span>in all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a brass cannelstick</span><br/>
<span>miss’n.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned</span><br/>
<span>I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She</span><br/>
<span>kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and</span><br/>
<span>everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking</span><br/>
<span>kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,</span><br/>
<span>with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in</span><br/>
<span>Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s _just_ as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time;</span><br/>
<span>and like as not you’ve got the other things there, too.  How’d it get</span><br/>
<span>there?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you know</span><br/>
<span>I would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before</span><br/>
<span>breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put</span><br/>
<span>my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain’t in; but</span><br/>
<span>I’ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I’ll know I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and</span><br/>
<span>took up the spoon, and--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, for the land’s sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go ‘long now, the whole</span><br/>
<span>kit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh me again till I’ve got back my</span><br/>
<span>peace of mind.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I’D a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it</span><br/>
<span>out; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d a been dead.  As we was</span><br/>
<span>passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the</span><br/>
<span>shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and</span><br/>
<span>laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom</span><br/>
<span>see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it ain’t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain’t</span><br/>
<span>reliable.” Then he says:  “But he done us a good turn with the spoon,</span><br/>
<span>anyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and do him one without _him_</span><br/>
<span>knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole</span><br/>
<span>hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard</span><br/>
<span>steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes</span><br/>
<span>the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t’other,</span><br/>
<span>looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,</span><br/>
<span>first to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d been to them all.</span><br/>
<span>Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle</span><br/>
<span>and thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,</span><br/>
<span>saying:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it.  I could</span><br/>
<span>show her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the rats.  But never</span><br/>
<span>mind--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn’t do no good.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a</span><br/>
<span>mighty nice old man.  And always is.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said</span><br/>
<span>we’d got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out</span><br/>
<span>he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the</span><br/>
<span>spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to</span><br/>
<span>counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of</span><br/>
<span>them up my sleeve, and Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons _yet_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Go ‘long to your play, and don’t bother me.  I know better, I counted</span><br/>
<span>‘m myself.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make but nine.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody</span><br/>
<span>would.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I declare to gracious ther’ _ain’t_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in</span><br/>
<span>the world--plague _take_ the things, I’ll count ‘m again.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy</span><br/>
<span>and bothered both.  But Tom says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Aunty, I don’t think there’s ten.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You numskull, didn’t you see me _count ‘m?_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know, but--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I’ll count ‘m _again_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.</span><br/>
<span>Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so</span><br/>
<span>mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d start</span><br/>
<span>to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they</span><br/>
<span>come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed</span><br/>
<span>up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat</span><br/>
<span>galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and if</span><br/>
<span>we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d skin</span><br/>
<span>us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst</span><br/>
<span>she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along</span><br/>
<span>with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with</span><br/>
<span>this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,</span><br/>
<span>because he said _now_ she couldn’t ever count them spoons twice alike</span><br/>
<span>again to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d counted them right if</span><br/>
<span>she _did_; and said that after she’d about counted her head off for the</span><br/>
<span>next three days he judged she’d give it up and offer to kill anybody</span><br/>
<span>that wanted her to ever count them any more.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of</span><br/>
<span>her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a</span><br/>
<span>couple of days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more,</span><br/>
<span>and she didn’t _care_, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her</span><br/>
<span>soul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her life;</span><br/>
<span>she druther die first.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon</span><br/>
<span>and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up</span><br/>
<span>counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it would</span><br/>
<span>blow over by and by.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We</span><br/>
<span>fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it</span><br/>
<span>done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we</span><br/>
<span>had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and</span><br/>
<span>we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with</span><br/>
<span>the smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course</span><br/>
<span>we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,</span><br/>
<span>in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore</span><br/>
<span>up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long</span><br/>
<span>before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person</span><br/>
<span>with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go</span><br/>
<span>into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope</span><br/>
<span>enough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over</span><br/>
<span>for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole</span><br/>
<span>dinner.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But we didn’t need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and</span><br/>
<span>so we throwed the rest away.  We didn’t cook none of the pies in the</span><br/>
<span>wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble</span><br/>
<span>brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged</span><br/>
<span>to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from</span><br/>
<span>England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early</span><br/>
<span>ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things</span><br/>
<span>that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they</span><br/>
<span>warn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked</span><br/>
<span>her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first</span><br/>
<span>pies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling on the last</span><br/>
<span>one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and</span><br/>
<span>loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the</span><br/>
<span>lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long</span><br/>
<span>handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a</span><br/>
<span>pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would</span><br/>
<span>want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope</span><br/>
<span>ladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t know nothing what I’m</span><br/>
<span>talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next</span><br/>
<span>time, too.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Nat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we put the</span><br/>
<span>three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim</span><br/>
<span>got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted</span><br/>
<span>into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,</span><br/>
<span>and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the</span><br/>
<span>window-hole.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXVIII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim</span><br/>
<span>allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That’s the</span><br/>
<span>one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have</span><br/>
<span>it; Tom said he’d _got_ to; there warn’t no case of a state prisoner not</span><br/>
<span>scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old</span><br/>
<span>Northumberland!  Why, Huck, s’pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what</span><br/>
<span>you going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim’s _got_ to do his</span><br/>
<span>inscription and coat of arms.  They all do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn but dish</span><br/>
<span>yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coat</span><br/>
<span>of arms, because he hain’t.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have one before</span><br/>
<span>he goes out of this--because he’s going out _right_, and there ain’t</span><br/>
<span>going to be no flaws in his record.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim</span><br/>
<span>a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,</span><br/>
<span>Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he’d</span><br/>
<span>struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but there</span><br/>
<span>was one which he reckoned he’d decide on.  He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire</span><br/>
<span>_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under</span><br/>
<span>his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a</span><br/>
<span>chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the</span><br/>
<span>nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,</span><br/>
<span>_sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a</span><br/>
<span>couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore</span><br/>
<span>Fretta, Minore Otto._  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the</span><br/>
<span>less speed.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in</span><br/>
<span>like all git-out.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s _some_ of it?  What’s a fess?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A fess--a fess is--_you_ don’t need to know what a fess is.  I’ll show</span><br/>
<span>him how to make it when he gets to it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.  What’s a bar</span><br/>
<span>sinister?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know.  But he’s got to have it.  All the nobility does.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That was just his way.  If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you,</span><br/>
<span>he wouldn’t do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make no</span><br/>
<span>difference.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to</span><br/>
<span>finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a</span><br/>
<span>mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He</span><br/>
<span>made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by</span><br/>
<span>the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely</span><br/>
<span>heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven</span><br/>
<span>years of solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after</span><br/>
<span>thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,</span><br/>
<span>natural son of Louis XIV.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.</span><br/>
<span>When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one for Jim</span><br/>
<span>to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed</span><br/>
<span>he would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a</span><br/>
<span>year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he</span><br/>
<span>didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block</span><br/>
<span>them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just</span><br/>
<span>follow the lines.  Then pretty soon he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log walls</span><br/>
<span>in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We’ll fetch</span><br/>
<span>a rock.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him</span><br/>
<span>such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out.</span><br/>
<span>But Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to</span><br/>
<span>see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky</span><br/>
<span>tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show to get</span><br/>
<span>well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and</span><br/>
<span>mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.</span><br/>
<span>There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it,</span><br/>
<span>and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,</span><br/>
<span>too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a grindstone</span><br/>
<span>nuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it.  It warn’t quite midnight yet,</span><br/>
<span>so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the</span><br/>
<span>grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough</span><br/>
<span>job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t keep her from falling</span><br/>
<span>over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was</span><br/>
<span>going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half</span><br/>
<span>way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We</span><br/>
<span>see it warn’t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his</span><br/>
<span>bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round</span><br/>
<span>his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim</span><br/>
<span>and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and</span><br/>
<span>Tom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He</span><br/>
<span>knowed how to do everything.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Our hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the grindstone</span><br/>
<span>through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom</span><br/>
<span>marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,</span><br/>
<span>with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the</span><br/>
<span>lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle</span><br/>
<span>quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under</span><br/>
<span>his straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back</span><br/>
<span>on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of</span><br/>
<span>something, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, we’ll get you some.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But bless you, honey, I doan’ _want_ none.  I’s afeard un um.  I jis’</span><br/>
<span>‘s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s a good idea.  And I reckon it’s been done.  It _must_ a been done;</span><br/>
<span>it stands to reason.  Yes, it’s a prime good idea.  Where could you keep</span><br/>
<span>it?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Keep what, Mars Tom?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, a rattlesnake.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to</span><br/>
<span>come in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid</span><br/>
<span>my head.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame</span><br/>
<span>it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Tame_ it!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,</span><br/>
<span>and they wouldn’t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book</span><br/>
<span>will tell you that.  You try--that’s all I ask; just try for two or three</span><br/>
<span>days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he’ll love you;</span><br/>
<span>and sleep with you; and won’t stay away from you a minute; and will let</span><br/>
<span>you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_’ talk so!  I can’t _stan_’ it!  He’d _let_</span><br/>
<span>me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain’t it?  I lay he’d wait a</span><br/>
<span>pow’ful long time ‘fo’ I _ast_ him.  En mo’ en dat, I doan’ _want_ him</span><br/>
<span>to sleep wid me.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Jim, don’t act so foolish.  A prisoner’s _got_ to have some kind of a</span><br/>
<span>dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever been tried, why, there’s more</span><br/>
<span>glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other</span><br/>
<span>way you could ever think of to save your life.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ _want_ no sich glory.  Snake take ‘n bite</span><br/>
<span>Jim’s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?  No, sah, I doan’ want no sich</span><br/>
<span>doin’s.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Blame it, can’t you _try_?  I only _want_ you to try--you needn’t keep</span><br/>
<span>it up if it don’t work.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I’s a tryin’ him.</span><br/>
<span>Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ anything ‘at ain’t onreasonable,</span><br/>
<span>but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I’s</span><br/>
<span>gwyne to _leave_, dat’s _shore_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bull-headed about it.</span><br/>
<span>We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on</span><br/>
<span>their tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that ‘ll have</span><br/>
<span>to do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I k’n stan’ _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame’ ‘f I couldn’ get along widout</span><br/>
<span>um, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b’fo’ ‘t was so much bother and</span><br/>
<span>trouble to be a prisoner.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it _always_ is when it’s done right.  You got any rats around</span><br/>
<span>here?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, sah, I hain’t seed none.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, we’ll get you some rats.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ _want_ no rats.  Dey’s de dadblamedest creturs</span><br/>
<span>to ‘sturb a body, en rustle roun’ over ‘im, en bite his feet, when he’s</span><br/>
<span>tryin’ to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ‘f I’s</span><br/>
<span>got to have ‘m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r um,</span><br/>
<span>skasely.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But, Jim, you _got_ to have ‘em--they all do.  So don’t make no more</span><br/>
<span>fuss about it.  Prisoners ain’t ever without rats.  There ain’t no</span><br/>
<span>instance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them</span><br/>
<span>tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play</span><br/>
<span>music to them.  You got anything to play music on?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper, en a juice-harp;</span><br/>
<span>but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a juice-harp.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes they would _they_ don’t care what kind of music ‘tis.  A</span><br/>
<span>jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in a</span><br/>
<span>prison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can’t get no</span><br/>
<span>other kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out</span><br/>
<span>to see what’s the matter with you.  Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed</span><br/>
<span>very well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,</span><br/>
<span>and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The Last Link</span><br/>
<span>is Broken’--that’s the thing that ‘ll scoop a rat quicker ‘n anything</span><br/>
<span>else; and when you’ve played about two minutes you’ll see all the rats,</span><br/>
<span>and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,</span><br/>
<span>and come.  And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good</span><br/>
<span>time.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, _dey_ will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_</span><br/>
<span>havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I’ll do it ef I got to.  I</span><br/>
<span>reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de</span><br/>
<span>house.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; and</span><br/>
<span>pretty soon he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, there’s one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you</span><br/>
<span>reckon?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable dark in heah,</span><br/>
<span>en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d be a pow’ful sight</span><br/>
<span>o’ trouble.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars</span><br/>
<span>Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you believe it.  We’ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in</span><br/>
<span>the corner over there, and raise it.  And don’t call it mullen, call it</span><br/>
<span>Pitchiola--that’s its right name when it’s in a prison.  And you want to</span><br/>
<span>water it with your tears.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You don’t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.</span><br/>
<span>It’s the way they always do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid</span><br/>
<span>spring water whiles another man’s a _start’n_ one wid tears.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That ain’t the idea.  You _got_ to do it with tears.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“She’ll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan’ skasely</span><br/>
<span>ever cry.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would</span><br/>
<span>have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised</span><br/>
<span>he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s</span><br/>
<span>coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ‘s soon have</span><br/>
<span>tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with the</span><br/>
<span>work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and</span><br/>
<span>petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of</span><br/>
<span>all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,</span><br/>
<span>and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to</span><br/>
<span>be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all</span><br/>
<span>patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier</span><br/>
<span>chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for</span><br/>
<span>himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and they was</span><br/>
<span>just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XXXIX.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and</span><br/>
<span>fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour</span><br/>
<span>we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put</span><br/>
<span>it in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed.  But while we was gone for</span><br/>
<span>spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found</span><br/>
<span>it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,</span><br/>
<span>and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was</span><br/>
<span>a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what</span><br/>
<span>they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted</span><br/>
<span>us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching</span><br/>
<span>another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t</span><br/>
<span>the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.</span><br/>
<span>I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and</span><br/>
<span>caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s</span><br/>
<span>nest, but we didn’t.  The family was at home.  We didn’t give it right</span><br/>
<span>up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’d</span><br/>
<span>tire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we</span><br/>
<span>got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right</span><br/>
<span>again, but couldn’t set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,</span><br/>
<span>and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in</span><br/>
<span>a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and</span><br/>
<span>a rattling good honest day’s work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!</span><br/>
<span>And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn’t</span><br/>
<span>half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn’t</span><br/>
<span>matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So</span><br/>
<span>we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn’t no real</span><br/>
<span>scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You’d see</span><br/>
<span>them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they</span><br/>
<span>generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most</span><br/>
<span>of the time where you didn’t want them.  Well, they was handsome and</span><br/>
<span>striped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that never</span><br/>
<span>made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what</span><br/>
<span>they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it; and</span><br/>
<span>every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make no difference</span><br/>
<span>what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I</span><br/>
<span>never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You</span><br/>
<span>couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if</span><br/>
<span>she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a</span><br/>
<span>howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old</span><br/>
<span>man so that he said he could most wish there hadn’t ever been no snakes</span><br/>
<span>created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the</span><br/>
<span>house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t</span><br/>
<span>near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could</span><br/>
<span>touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump</span><br/>
<span>right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all</span><br/>
<span>women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or</span><br/>
<span>other.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she</span><br/>
<span>allowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we ever</span><br/>
<span>loaded up the place again with them.  I didn’t mind the lickings,</span><br/>
<span>because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we</span><br/>
<span>had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other</span><br/>
<span>things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was when they’d</span><br/>
<span>all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn’t like the spiders,</span><br/>
<span>and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him, and make it</span><br/>
<span>mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes</span><br/>
<span>and the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him, skasely; and</span><br/>
<span>when there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively, and it was</span><br/>
<span>always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but</span><br/>
<span>took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and</span><br/>
<span>when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one</span><br/>
<span>gang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having a circus over him,</span><br/>
<span>and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at</span><br/>
<span>him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn’t</span><br/>
<span>ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.</span><br/>
<span>The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he</span><br/>
<span>would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;</span><br/>
<span>the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the</span><br/>
<span>grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,</span><br/>
<span>and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all</span><br/>
<span>going to die, but didn’t.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever</span><br/>
<span>see; and Tom said the same.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we was</span><br/>
<span>all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote</span><br/>
<span>a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their</span><br/>
<span>runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t no such</span><br/>
<span>plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and</span><br/>
<span>New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me</span><br/>
<span>the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom said, now</span><br/>
<span>for the nonnamous letters.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What’s them?”  I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it’s done one</span><br/>
<span>way, sometimes another.  But there’s always somebody spying around that</span><br/>
<span>gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going</span><br/>
<span>to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It’s a very good</span><br/>
<span>way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We’ll use them both.  And it’s</span><br/>
<span>usual for the prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and she</span><br/>
<span>stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We’ll do that, too.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that</span><br/>
<span>something’s up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it’s their</span><br/>
<span>lookout.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them.  It’s the way they’ve acted</span><br/>
<span>from the very start--left us to do _everything_.  They’re so confiding</span><br/>
<span>and mullet-headed they don’t take notice of nothing at all.  So if we</span><br/>
<span>don’t _give_ them notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere</span><br/>
<span>with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ‘ll go</span><br/>
<span>off perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing--won’t be nothing _to_ it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But I ain’t going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits</span><br/>
<span>me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You’ll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that</span><br/>
<span>yaller girl’s frock.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Tom, that ‘ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she</span><br/>
<span>prob’bly hain’t got any but that one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the</span><br/>
<span>nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my</span><br/>
<span>own togs.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“That ain’t got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just</span><br/>
<span>to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or</span><br/>
<span>not. Hain’t you got no principle at all?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the servant-girl.  Who’s Jim’s</span><br/>
<span>mother?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m his mother.  I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Not much.  I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed</span><br/>
<span>to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ‘ll take the nigger woman’s</span><br/>
<span>gown off of me and wear it, and we’ll all evade together.  When a</span><br/>
<span>prisoner of style escapes it’s called an evasion.  It’s always called</span><br/>
<span>so when a king escapes, f’rinstance.  And the same with a king’s son;</span><br/>
<span>it don’t make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural</span><br/>
<span>one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’s</span><br/>
<span>frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the</span><br/>
<span>way Tom told me to.  It said:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and</span><br/>
<span>crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on</span><br/>
<span>the back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn’t a</span><br/>
<span>been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them</span><br/>
<span>behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If</span><br/>
<span>a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell,</span><br/>
<span>she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she</span><br/>
<span>warn’t noticing, she done the same; she couldn’t face noway and be</span><br/>
<span>satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every</span><br/>
<span>time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and</span><br/>
<span>before she’d got two-thirds around she’d whirl back again, and say it</span><br/>
<span>again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up.  So the</span><br/>
<span>thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work</span><br/>
<span>more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the</span><br/>
<span>streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we</span><br/>
<span>better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going</span><br/>
<span>to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the</span><br/>
<span>lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,</span><br/>
<span>and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter</span><br/>
<span>said:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Don’t betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of</span><br/>
<span>cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway</span><br/>
<span>nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will</span><br/>
<span>stay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have</span><br/>
<span>got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and</span><br/>
<span>will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,</span><br/>
<span>along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the</span><br/>
<span>nigger’s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn</span><br/>
<span>if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as</span><br/>
<span>they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his</span><br/>
<span>chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your</span><br/>
<span>leasure.  Don’t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do</span><br/>
<span>they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish</span><br/>
<span>any reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XL.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went</span><br/>
<span>over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a</span><br/>
<span>look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,</span><br/>
<span>and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which end they</span><br/>
<span>was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done</span><br/>
<span>supper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a</span><br/>
<span>word about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed as much</span><br/>
<span>about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her</span><br/>
<span>back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good</span><br/>
<span>lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about</span><br/>
<span>half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole and</span><br/>
<span>was going to start with the lunch, but says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Where’s the butter?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain’t here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We can get along without it,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“We can get along _with_ it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellar</span><br/>
<span>and fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come</span><br/>
<span>along. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to represent his</span><br/>
<span>mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as</span><br/>
<span>you get there.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as</span><br/>
<span>a person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of</span><br/>
<span>corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs</span><br/>
<span>very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes</span><br/>
<span>Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped</span><br/>
<span>my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You been down cellar?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes’m.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What you been doing down there?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Noth’n.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Noth’n!_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No’m.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I don’t know ‘m.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You don’t _know_?  Don’t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what</span><br/>
<span>you been _doing_ down there.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I</span><br/>
<span>have.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I</span><br/>
<span>s’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat</span><br/>
<span>about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so she says,</span><br/>
<span>very decided:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You</span><br/>
<span>been up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll find out what it</span><br/>
<span>is before I’M done with you.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.</span><br/>
<span>My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them</span><br/>
<span>had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.</span><br/>
<span>They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,</span><br/>
<span>and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn’t;</span><br/>
<span>but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,</span><br/>
<span>and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their</span><br/>
<span>seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn’t easy myself, but I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t take my hat off, all the same.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if</span><br/>
<span>she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone this</span><br/>
<span>thing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got ourselves into, so</span><br/>
<span>we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before</span><br/>
<span>these rips got out of patience and come for us.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn’t_ answer</span><br/>
<span>them straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because these men</span><br/>
<span>was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and</span><br/>
<span>lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few minutes to</span><br/>
<span>midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the</span><br/>
<span>sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and</span><br/>
<span>me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was</span><br/>
<span>that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter</span><br/>
<span>beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon, when one of them says, “I’M for going and getting in the cabin</span><br/>
<span>_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,” I most</span><br/>
<span>dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and</span><br/>
<span>Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“For the land’s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?  He’s got the</span><br/>
<span>brain-fever as shore as you’re born, and they’re oozing out!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes</span><br/>
<span>the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and</span><br/>
<span>hugged me, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it</span><br/>
<span>ain’t no worse; for luck’s against us, and it never rains but it pours,</span><br/>
<span>and when I see that truck I thought we’d lost you, for I knowed by</span><br/>
<span>the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,</span><br/>
<span>dear, whyd’nt you _tell_ me that was what you’d been down there for, I</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don’t lemme see no more of</span><br/>
<span>you till morning!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,</span><br/>
<span>and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn’t hardly get my</span><br/>
<span>words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must</span><br/>
<span>jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,</span><br/>
<span>with guns!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>His eyes just blazed; and he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No!--is that so?  _ain’t_ it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over</span><br/>
<span>again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hurry!  _Hurry_!”  I says.  “Where’s Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.</span><br/>
<span>He’s dressed, and everything’s ready.  Now we’ll slide out and give the</span><br/>
<span>sheep-signal.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them</span><br/>
<span>begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I _told_ you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come--the door is locked.</span><br/>
<span>Here, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for ‘em in the</span><br/>
<span>dark and kill ‘em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,</span><br/>
<span>and listen if you can hear ‘em coming.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on</span><br/>
<span>us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all</span><br/>
<span>right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,</span><br/>
<span>and Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders.  Now we was in the</span><br/>
<span>lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,</span><br/>
<span>and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn’t make</span><br/>
<span>out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen</span><br/>
<span>for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out</span><br/>
<span>first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and</span><br/>
<span>listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all</span><br/>
<span>the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,</span><br/>
<span>not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy</span><br/>
<span>towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim</span><br/>
<span>over it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top</span><br/>
<span>rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which</span><br/>
<span>snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks</span><br/>
<span>and started somebody sings out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who’s that?  Answer, or I’ll shoot!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there</span><br/>
<span>was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed</span><br/>
<span>around us! We heard them sing out:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Here they are!  They’ve broke for the river!  After ‘em, boys, and turn</span><br/>
<span>loose the dogs!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore</span><br/>
<span>boots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell.  We was</span><br/>
<span>in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we</span><br/>
<span>dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind</span><br/>
<span>them.  They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off the</span><br/>
<span>robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they</span><br/>
<span>come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we</span><br/>
<span>stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’t</span><br/>
<span>nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said</span><br/>
<span>howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and</span><br/>
<span>then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly</span><br/>
<span>to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was</span><br/>
<span>tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the</span><br/>
<span>river, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we</span><br/>
<span>struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and</span><br/>
<span>we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the</span><br/>
<span>bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when</span><br/>
<span>we stepped on to the raft I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Now_, old Jim, you’re a free man again, and I bet you won’t ever be a</span><br/>
<span>slave no more.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It ‘uz planned beautiful, en</span><br/>
<span>it ‘uz done beautiful; en dey ain’t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat’s mo’</span><br/>
<span>mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because</span><br/>
<span>he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did</span><br/>
<span>before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in</span><br/>
<span>the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him, but</span><br/>
<span>he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don’t stop now; don’t fool around</span><br/>
<span>here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set</span><br/>
<span>her loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--‘deed we did.  I wish _we’d_ a</span><br/>
<span>had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of Saint</span><br/>
<span>Louis, ascend to heaven!’ wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we’d</span><br/>
<span>a whooped him over the _border_--that’s what we’d a done with _him_--and</span><br/>
<span>done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the</span><br/>
<span>sweeps!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we’d thought a</span><br/>
<span>minute, I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Say it, Jim.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz _him_ dat ‘uz</span><br/>
<span>bein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, ‘Go on</span><br/>
<span>en save me, nemmine ‘bout a doctor f’r to save dis one?’  Is dat like</span><br/>
<span>Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You _bet_ he wouldn’t!  _well_,</span><br/>
<span>den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan’ budge a step out’n dis</span><br/>
<span>place ‘dout a _doctor_, not if it’s forty year!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did say--so</span><br/>
<span>it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.</span><br/>
<span>He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and</span><br/>
<span>wouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose</span><br/>
<span>himself; but we wouldn’t let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind,</span><br/>
<span>but it didn’t do no good.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the way to do when you</span><br/>
<span>get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and</span><br/>
<span>fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse</span><br/>
<span>full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the</span><br/>
<span>back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the</span><br/>
<span>canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take</span><br/>
<span>his chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till you get him</span><br/>
<span>back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it</span><br/>
<span>again. It’s the way they all do.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he</span><br/>
<span>see the doctor coming till he was gone again.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XLI.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got</span><br/>
<span>him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting</span><br/>
<span>yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about</span><br/>
<span>midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and</span><br/>
<span>shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and</span><br/>
<span>not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to</span><br/>
<span>come home this evening and surprise the folks.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Who is your folks?” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The Phelpses, down yonder.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh,” he says.  And after a minute, he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“How’d you say he got shot?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Singular dream,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But</span><br/>
<span>when he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her--said she was big</span><br/>
<span>enough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two.  I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy</span><br/>
<span>enough.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What three?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that’s what I mean.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh,” he says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,</span><br/>
<span>and said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one.  But they was</span><br/>
<span>all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait</span><br/>
<span>till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better</span><br/>
<span>go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But</span><br/>
<span>I said I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he</span><br/>
<span>started.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos’n he can’t fix</span><br/>
<span>that leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying is?</span><br/>
<span>spos’n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay</span><br/>
<span>around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what</span><br/>
<span>_I’ll_ do.  I’ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he’s got to</span><br/>
<span>go any more I’ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tie</span><br/>
<span>him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom’s done</span><br/>
<span>with him we’ll give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then let him</span><br/>
<span>get ashore.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I</span><br/>
<span>waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the</span><br/>
<span>doctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the night some time</span><br/>
<span>or other, and warn’t back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad</span><br/>
<span>for Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,</span><br/>
<span>and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s</span><br/>
<span>stomach! He says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, _Tom!_  Where you been all this time, you rascal?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runaway</span><br/>
<span>nigger--me and Sid.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, where ever did you go?” he says.  “Your aunt’s been mighty</span><br/>
<span>uneasy.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right.  We followed the men</span><br/>
<span>and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we</span><br/>
<span>heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and</span><br/>
<span>crossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of them; so we cruised along</span><br/>
<span>up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe</span><br/>
<span>and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we</span><br/>
<span>paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at the post-office to see</span><br/>
<span>what he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to get something to eat for</span><br/>
<span>us, and then we’re going home.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as I</span><br/>
<span>suspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the</span><br/>
<span>office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the old man</span><br/>
<span>said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done</span><br/>
<span>fooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn’t get him to let me stay</span><br/>
<span>and wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use in it, and I must come</span><br/>
<span>along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and</span><br/>
<span>cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that</span><br/>
<span>don’t amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when he come.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to dinner;</span><br/>
<span>and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the</span><br/>
<span>worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ I b’lieve</span><br/>
<span>the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn’t I, Sister</span><br/>
<span>Damrell?--s’I, he’s crazy, s’I--them’s the very words I said.  You all</span><br/>
<span>hearn me: he’s crazy, s’I; everything shows it, s’I.  Look at that-air</span><br/>
<span>grindstone, s’I; want to tell _me_’t any cretur ‘t’s in his right mind</span><br/>
<span>‘s a goin’ to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s’I?</span><br/>
<span>Here sich ‘n’ sich a person busted his heart; ‘n’ here so ‘n’ so</span><br/>
<span>pegged along for thirty-seven year, ‘n’ all that--natcherl son o’ Louis</span><br/>
<span>somebody, ‘n’ sich everlast’n rubbage.  He’s plumb crazy, s’I; it’s what</span><br/>
<span>I says in the fust place, it’s what I says in the middle, ‘n’ it’s what</span><br/>
<span>I says last ‘n’ all the time--the nigger’s crazy--crazy ‘s Nebokoodneezer,</span><br/>
<span>s’I.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“An’ look at that-air ladder made out’n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,” says</span><br/>
<span>old Mrs. Damrell; “what in the name o’ goodness _could_ he ever want</span><br/>
<span>of--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The very words I was a-sayin’ no longer ago th’n this minute to Sister</span><br/>
<span>Utterback, ‘n’ she’ll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag</span><br/>
<span>ladder, sh-she; ‘n’ s’I, yes, _look_ at it, s’I--what _could_ he a-wanted</span><br/>
<span>of it, s’I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But how in the nation’d they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,</span><br/>
<span>_anyway_? ‘n’ who dug that-air _hole_? ‘n’ who--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“My very _words_, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin’--pass that-air sasser o’</span><br/>
<span>m’lasses, won’t ye?--I was a-sayin’ to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,</span><br/>
<span>how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s’I.  Without _help_, mind</span><br/>
<span>you--‘thout _help_!  _that’s_ wher ‘tis.  Don’t tell _me_, s’I; there</span><br/>
<span>_wuz_ help, s’I; ‘n’ ther’ wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s’I; ther’s ben a</span><br/>
<span>_dozen_ a-helpin’ that nigger, ‘n’ I lay I’d skin every last nigger on</span><br/>
<span>this place but _I’d_ find out who done it, s’I; ‘n’ moreover, s’I--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn’t a done every thing that’s been</span><br/>
<span>done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they’ve been</span><br/>
<span>made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with ‘m, a week’s work for six men;</span><br/>
<span>look at that nigger made out’n straw on the bed; and look at--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower!  It’s jist as I was a-sayin’</span><br/>
<span>to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S’e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister</span><br/>
<span>Hotchkiss, s’e? Think o’ what, Brer Phelps, s’I?  Think o’ that bed-leg</span><br/>
<span>sawed off that a way, s’e?  _think_ of it, s’I?  I lay it never sawed</span><br/>
<span>_itself_ off, s’I--somebody _sawed_ it, s’I; that’s my opinion, take it</span><br/>
<span>or leave it, it mayn’t be no ‘count, s’I, but sich as ‘t is, it’s my</span><br/>
<span>opinion, s’I, ‘n’ if any body k’n start a better one, s’I, let him _do_</span><br/>
<span>it, s’I, that’s all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s’I--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o’ niggers in there</span><br/>
<span>every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look</span><br/>
<span>at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African</span><br/>
<span>writ’n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv ‘m at it right along, all</span><br/>
<span>the time, amost.  Why, I’d give two dollars to have it read to me; ‘n’</span><br/>
<span>as for the niggers that wrote it, I ‘low I’d take ‘n’ lash ‘m t’ll--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“People to _help_ him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you’d _think_</span><br/>
<span>so if you’d a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they’ve stole</span><br/>
<span>everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,</span><br/>
<span>mind you. They stole that shirt right off o’ the line! and as for that</span><br/>
<span>sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther’ ain’t no telling how</span><br/>
<span>many times they _didn’t_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and</span><br/>
<span>candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand</span><br/>
<span>things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and</span><br/>
<span>Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was</span><br/>
<span>a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight</span><br/>
<span>nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they</span><br/>
<span>slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_</span><br/>
<span>but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that</span><br/>
<span>nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs</span><br/>
<span>right on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs</span><br/>
<span>anything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn’t a done better and</span><br/>
<span>been no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_</span><br/>
<span>know our dogs, and ther’ ain’t no better; well, them dogs never even got</span><br/>
<span>on the _track_ of ‘m once!  You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_</span><br/>
<span>of you!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it does beat--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Laws alive, I never--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“So help me, I wouldn’t a be--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_House_-thieves as well as--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Goodnessgracioussakes, I’d a ben afeard to live in sich a--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“‘Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn’t hardly go to bed, or</span><br/>
<span>get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they’d steal</span><br/>
<span>the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was</span><br/>
<span>in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn’t</span><br/>
<span>afraid they’d steal some o’ the family!  I was just to that pass I</span><br/>
<span>didn’t have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough</span><br/>
<span>_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there’s my two poor boys</span><br/>
<span>asleep, ‘way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness</span><br/>
<span>I was that uneasy ‘t I crep’ up there and locked ‘em in!  I _did_.  And</span><br/>
<span>anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it</span><br/>
<span>keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your</span><br/>
<span>wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o’ wild things,</span><br/>
<span>and by and by you think to yourself, spos’n I was a boy, and was away up</span><br/>
<span>there, and the door ain’t locked, and you--” She stopped, looking kind</span><br/>
<span>of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye</span><br/>
<span>lit on me--I got up and took a walk.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that</span><br/>
<span>room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.</span><br/>
<span>So I done it.  But I dasn’t go fur, or she’d a sent for me.  And when</span><br/>
<span>it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and</span><br/>
<span>told her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door was</span><br/>
<span>locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,</span><br/>
<span>and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t never want to try _that_</span><br/>
<span>no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas</span><br/>
<span>before; and then she said she’d forgive us, and maybe it was all right</span><br/>
<span>enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys</span><br/>
<span>was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long</span><br/>
<span>as no harm hadn’t come of it, she judged she better put in her time</span><br/>
<span>being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of</span><br/>
<span>fretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted</span><br/>
<span>me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty</span><br/>
<span>soon jumps up, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet!  What _has_</span><br/>
<span>become of that boy?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’ll run right up to town and get him,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No you won’t,” she says.  “You’ll stay right wher’ you are; _one’s_</span><br/>
<span>enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain’t here to supper, your uncle ‘ll</span><br/>
<span>go.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, he warn’t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’s</span><br/>
<span>track. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said</span><br/>
<span>there warn’t no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you’ll</span><br/>
<span>see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had</span><br/>
<span>to be satisfied.  But she said she’d set up for him a while anyway, and</span><br/>
<span>keep a light burning so he could see it.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her</span><br/>
<span>candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like</span><br/>
<span>I couldn’t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked</span><br/>
<span>with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t</span><br/>
<span>seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every</span><br/>
<span>now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe</span><br/>
<span>drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or</span><br/>
<span>dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down</span><br/>
<span>silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home</span><br/>
<span>in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,</span><br/>
<span>and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her</span><br/>
<span>good, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she</span><br/>
<span>looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the window and</span><br/>
<span>the rod; but you’ll be good, _won’t_ you?  And you won’t go?  For _my_</span><br/>
<span>sake.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all</span><br/>
<span>intending to go; but after that I wouldn’t a went, not for kingdoms.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.</span><br/>
<span>And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around</span><br/>
<span>front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her</span><br/>
<span>eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do</span><br/>
<span>something for her, but I couldn’t, only to swear that I wouldn’t never</span><br/>
<span>do nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at</span><br/>
<span>dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,</span><br/>
<span>and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter XLII.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no</span><br/>
<span>track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying</span><br/>
<span>nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not</span><br/>
<span>eating anything. And by and by the old man says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did I give you the letter?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What letter?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, you didn’t give me no letter.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I must a forgot it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had</span><br/>
<span>laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg--it’s from Sis.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir.  But</span><br/>
<span>before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see</span><br/>
<span>something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old</span><br/>
<span>doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;</span><br/>
<span>and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come</span><br/>
<span>handy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,</span><br/>
<span>which showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,</span><br/>
<span>and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He’s alive, thank God!  And that’s enough!” and she snatched a kiss of</span><br/>
<span>him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders</span><br/>
<span>right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue</span><br/>
<span>could go, every jump of the way.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the</span><br/>
<span>old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men</span><br/>
<span>was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to</span><br/>
<span>all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run</span><br/>
<span>away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a</span><br/>
<span>whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others</span><br/>
<span>said, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, and</span><br/>
<span>his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled</span><br/>
<span>them down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxious</span><br/>
<span>for to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the very</span><br/>
<span>ones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got their</span><br/>
<span>satisfaction out of him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the</span><br/>
<span>head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to</span><br/>
<span>know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes</span><br/>
<span>on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to</span><br/>
<span>a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and</span><br/>
<span>both legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to</span><br/>
<span>eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because</span><br/>
<span>he didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and</span><br/>
<span>said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the</span><br/>
<span>cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and</span><br/>
<span>about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with</span><br/>
<span>a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and</span><br/>
<span>takes a look, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t</span><br/>
<span>a bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cut</span><br/>
<span>the bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for</span><br/>
<span>me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little</span><br/>
<span>worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t let</span><br/>
<span>me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d kill</span><br/>
<span>me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t do</span><br/>
<span>anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and</span><br/>
<span>the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says</span><br/>
<span>he’ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I</span><br/>
<span>judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had</span><br/>
<span>to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It</span><br/>
<span>was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and</span><br/>
<span>of course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t,</span><br/>
<span>because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet</span><br/>
<span>never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick</span><br/>
<span>plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a</span><br/>
<span>better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,</span><br/>
<span>and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked</span><br/>
<span>main hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a</span><br/>
<span>nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I</span><br/>
<span>had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he</span><br/>
<span>would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I</span><br/>
<span>_was_, with both of ‘m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about</span><br/>
<span>dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck</span><br/>
<span>would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped</span><br/>
<span>on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped</span><br/>
<span>up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was</span><br/>
<span>about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a</span><br/>
<span>flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and</span><br/>
<span>towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least</span><br/>
<span>row nor said a word from the start.  He ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen;</span><br/>
<span>that’s what I think about him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Somebody says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful</span><br/>
<span>to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was</span><br/>
<span>according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good</span><br/>
<span>heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they</span><br/>
<span>all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some</span><br/>
<span>notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out</span><br/>
<span>and hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he</span><br/>
<span>could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten</span><br/>
<span>heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they</span><br/>
<span>didn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, but</span><br/>
<span>I judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as</span><br/>
<span>soon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of</span><br/>
<span>me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot</span><br/>
<span>when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling</span><br/>
<span>around hunting the runaway nigger.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day</span><br/>
<span>and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged</span><br/>
<span>him.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt</span><br/>
<span>Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I</span><br/>
<span>found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that</span><br/>
<span>would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and</span><br/>
<span>pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and</span><br/>
<span>laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding</span><br/>
<span>in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and</span><br/>
<span>set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful</span><br/>
<span>now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping</span><br/>
<span>like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the</span><br/>
<span>time, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his</span><br/>
<span>eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Hello!--why, I’m at _home_!  How’s that?  Where’s the raft?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“It’s all right,” I says.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“And _Jim_?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash.  But he never</span><br/>
<span>noticed, but says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we’re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What whole thing?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, _the_ whole thing.  There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway</span><br/>
<span>nigger free--me and Tom.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Good land!  Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about!  Dear, dear,</span><br/>
<span>out of his head again!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_No_, I ain’t out of my _head_; I know all what I’m talking about.  We</span><br/>
<span>_did_ set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.</span><br/>
<span>And we done it elegant, too.”  He’d got a start, and she never checked</span><br/>
<span>him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and</span><br/>
<span>I see it warn’t no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a</span><br/>
<span>power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was</span><br/>
<span>all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,</span><br/>
<span>and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the</span><br/>
<span>warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,</span><br/>
<span>and you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and</span><br/>
<span>inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think _half_ the</span><br/>
<span>fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,</span><br/>
<span>and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the</span><br/>
<span>lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder</span><br/>
<span>and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work</span><br/>
<span>with in your apron pocket--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Mercy sakes!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for</span><br/>
<span>Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that</span><br/>
<span>you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before</span><br/>
<span>we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let</span><br/>
<span>drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let</span><br/>
<span>them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but</span><br/>
<span>went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the</span><br/>
<span>raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by</span><br/>
<span>ourselves, and _wasn’t_ it bully, Aunty!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was</span><br/>
<span>_you_, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all this trouble,</span><br/>
<span>and turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to</span><br/>
<span>death.  I’ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out</span><br/>
<span>o’ you this very minute.  To think, here I’ve been, night after night,</span><br/>
<span>a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old</span><br/>
<span>Harry out o’ both o’ ye!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn’t_ hold in,</span><br/>
<span>and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all</span><br/>
<span>along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she</span><br/>
<span>says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I</span><br/>
<span>tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Meddling with _who_?”  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking</span><br/>
<span>surprised.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“With _who_?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who’d you reckon?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn’t he got away?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Him_?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger?  ‘Deed he hasn’t.</span><br/>
<span>They’ve got him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that cabin again,</span><br/>
<span>on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or</span><br/>
<span>sold!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening</span><br/>
<span>and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They hain’t no _right_ to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don’t you lose a</span><br/>
<span>minute.  Turn him loose! he ain’t no slave; he’s as free as any cretur</span><br/>
<span>that walks this earth!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What _does_ the child mean?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t go, _I’ll_</span><br/>
<span>go. I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss</span><br/>
<span>Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to</span><br/>
<span>sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her</span><br/>
<span>will.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was</span><br/>
<span>already free?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why,</span><br/>
<span>I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep in blood</span><br/>
<span>to--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>If she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as</span><br/>
<span>sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and</span><br/>
<span>cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,</span><br/>
<span>for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped</span><br/>
<span>out, and in a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and</span><br/>
<span>stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding</span><br/>
<span>him into the earth, you know.  And then she says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes, you _better_ turn y’r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so?  Why, that ain’t</span><br/>
<span>_Tom_, it’s Sid; Tom’s--Tom’s--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute</span><br/>
<span>ago.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You mean where’s Huck _Finn_--that’s what you mean!  I reckon I hain’t</span><br/>
<span>raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I</span><br/>
<span>_see_ him.  That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that</span><br/>
<span>bed, Huck Finn.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So I done it.  But not feeling brash.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever</span><br/>
<span>see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told</span><br/>
<span>it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t</span><br/>
<span>know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting</span><br/>
<span>sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the</span><br/>
<span>oldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it.  So Tom’s Aunt Polly,</span><br/>
<span>she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how</span><br/>
<span>I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom</span><br/>
<span>Sawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’m</span><br/>
<span>used to it now, and ‘tain’t no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally took</span><br/>
<span>me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn’t no other way, and</span><br/>
<span>I knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being</span><br/>
<span>a mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly</span><br/>
<span>satisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made</span><br/>
<span>things as soft as he could for me.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting</span><br/>
<span>Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took</span><br/>
<span>all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t</span><br/>
<span>ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_</span><br/>
<span>help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and</span><br/>
<span>_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that</span><br/>
<span>way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all</span><br/>
<span>the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that</span><br/>
<span>creetur’s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn’t seem to get any</span><br/>
<span>answer out of you about it.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean</span><br/>
<span>by Sid being here.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I never got ‘em, Sis.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“You, Tom!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well--_what_?” he says, kind of pettish.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Don’t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“What letters?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“_Them_ letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I’ll--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“They’re in the trunk.  There, now.  And they’re just the same as they</span><br/>
<span>was when I got them out of the office.  I hain’t looked into them, I</span><br/>
<span>hain’t touched them.  But I knowed they’d make trouble, and I thought if</span><br/>
<span>you warn’t in no hurry, I’d--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it.  And I</span><br/>
<span>wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose he--”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but _it’s_ all right, I’ve</span><br/>
<span>got that one.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned maybe it</span><br/>
<span>was just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span># Chapter THE LAST</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time</span><br/>
<span>of the evasion?--what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion worked all</span><br/>
<span>right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?</span><br/>
<span>And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got</span><br/>
<span>Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and</span><br/>
<span>have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about</span><br/>
<span>his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,</span><br/>
<span>and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all</span><br/>
<span>the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight</span><br/>
<span>procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would</span><br/>
<span>we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle</span><br/>
<span>Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,</span><br/>
<span>they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him</span><br/>
<span>all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had</span><br/>
<span>him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty</span><br/>
<span>dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,</span><br/>
<span>and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson</span><br/>
<span>islan’?  I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas’, en what’s de sign un it; en</span><br/>
<span>I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it’s</span><br/>
<span>come true; en heah she is!  _dah_, now! doan’ talk to _me_--signs is</span><br/>
<span>_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis’ ‘s well ‘at I ‘uz gwineter be</span><br/>
<span>rich agin as I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minute!”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all three</span><br/>
<span>slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for</span><br/>
<span>howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a</span><br/>
<span>couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I</span><br/>
<span>ain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t get</span><br/>
<span>none from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and got</span><br/>
<span>it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, he hain’t,” Tom says; “it’s all there yet--six thousand dollars</span><br/>
<span>and more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since.  Hadn’t when I come</span><br/>
<span>away, anyhow.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Jim says, kind of solemn:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>I says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Why, Jim?”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Doan’ you ‘member de house dat was float’n down de river, en dey wuz a</span><br/>
<span>man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn’ let you</span><br/>
<span>come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo’ money when you wants it, kase dat</span><br/>
<span>wuz him.”</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Tom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard</span><br/>
<span>for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain’t</span><br/>
<span>nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I’d</span><br/>
<span>a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’t a tackled it,</span><br/>
<span>and ain’t a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the</span><br/>
<span>Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me</span><br/>
<span>and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it.  I been there before.</span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>THE END. YOURS TRULY, _HUCK FINN_.</span><br/>
